<h1>ALEXANDRIA AND HER SCHOOLS. <a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a></h1>
<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">should</span> not have presumed to
choose for any lectures of mine such a subject as that which I
have tried to treat in this book.&nbsp; The subject was chosen by
the Institution where the lectures were delivered.&nbsp; Still
less should I have presumed to print them of my own accord,
knowing how fragmentary and crude they are.&nbsp; They were
printed at the special request of my audience.&nbsp; Least of
all, perhaps, ought I to have presumed to publish them, as I have
done, at Cambridge, where any inaccuracy or sciolism (and that
such defects exist in these pages, I cannot but fear) would be
instantly detected, and severely censured: but nevertheless, it
seemed to me that Cambridge was the fittest place in which they
could see the light, because to Cambridge I mainly owe what
little right method or sound thought may be found in them, or
indeed, in anything which I have ever written.&nbsp; In the
heyday of youthful greediness and ambition, when the mind,
dazzled by the vastness and variety of the universe, must needs
know everything, or rather know about everything, at once and on
the spot, too many are apt, as I have been in past years, to
complain of Cambridge studies as too dry and narrow: but as time
teaches the student, year by year, what is really required for an
understanding of the objects with which he meets, he begins to
find that his University, in as far as he has really received her
teaching into himself, has given him, in her criticism, her
mathematics, above all, in Plato, something which all the popular
knowledge, the lectures and institutions of the day, and even
good books themselves, cannot give, a boon more precious than
learning; namely, the art of learning.&nbsp; That instead of
casting into his lazy lap treasures which he would not have known
how to use, she has taught him to mine for them himself; and has
by her wise refusal to gratify his intellectual greediness,
excited his hunger, only that he may be the stronger to hunt and
till for his own subsistence; and thus, the deeper he drinks, in
after years, at fountains wisely forbidden to him while he was a
Cambridge student, and sees his old companions growing up into
sound-headed and sound-hearted practical men, liberal and
expansive, and yet with a firm standing-ground for thought and
action, he learns to complain less and less of Cambridge studies,
and more and more of that conceit and haste of his own, which
kept him from reaping the full advantage of her training.</p>
<p>These Lectures, as I have said, are altogether crude and
fragmentary&mdash;how, indeed, could they be otherwise, dealing
with so vast a subject, and so long a period of time?&nbsp; They
are meant neither as Essays nor as Orations, but simply as a
collection of hints to those who may wish to work out the subject
for themselves; and, I trust, as giving some glimpses of a
central idea, in the light of which the spiritual history of
Alexandria, and perhaps of other countries also, may be seen to
have in itself a coherence and organic method.</p>
<p>I was of course compelled, by the circumstances under which
these Lectures were delivered, to keep clear of all points which
are commonly called &ldquo;controversial.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot
but feel that this was a gain, rather than a loss; because it
forced me, if I wished to give any interpretation at all of
Alexandrian thought, any Theodicy at all of her fate, to refer to
laws which I cannot but believe to be deeper, wider, more truly
eternal than the points which cause most of our modern
controversies, either theological or political; laws which will,
I cannot but believe also, reassert themselves, and have to be
reasserted by all wise teachers, very soon indeed, and it may be
under most novel embodiments, but without any change in their
eternal spirit.</p>
<p>For I may say, I hope, now (what if said ten years ago would
have only excited laughter), that I cannot but subscribe to the
opinion of the many wise men who believe that Europe, and England
as an integral part thereof, is on the eve of a revolution,
spiritual and political, as vast and awful as that which took
place at the Reformation; and that, beneficial as that revolution
will doubtless be to the destinies of mankind in general, it
depends upon the wisdom and courage of each nation individually,
whether that great deluge shall issue, as the Reformation did, in
a fresh outgrowth of European nobleness and strength or usher in,
after pitiable confusions and sorrows, a second Byzantine age of
stereotyped effeminacy and imbecility.&nbsp; For I have as little
sympathy with those who prate so loudly of the progress of the
species, and the advent of I know-not-what Cockaigne of universal
peace and plenty, as I have with those who believe on the
strength of &ldquo;unfulfilled prophecy,&rdquo; the downfall of
Christianity, and the end of the human race to be at hand.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, one may well believe that prophecy will be
fulfilled in this great crisis, as it is in every great crisis,
although one be unable to conceive by what method of symbolism
the drying up of the Euphrates can be twisted to signify the fall
of Constantinople: and one can well believe that a day of
judgment is at hand, in which for every nation and institution,
the wheat will be sifted out and gathered into God&rsquo;s
garner, for the use of future generations, and the chaff burnt up
with that fire unquenchable which will try every man&rsquo;s
work, without being of opinion that after a few more years are
over, the great majority of the human race will be consigned
hopelessly to never-ending torments.</p>
<p>If prophecy be indeed a divine message to man; if it be
anything but a cabbala, useless either to the simple-minded or to
the logical, intended only for the plaything of a few devout
fancies, it must declare the unchangeable laws by which the
unchangeable God is governing, and has always governed, the human
race; and therefore only by understanding what has happened, can
we understand what will happen; only by understanding history,
can we understand prophecy; and that not merely by picking
out&mdash;too often arbitrarily and unfairly&mdash;a few names
and dates from the records of all the ages, but by trying to
discover its organic laws, and the causes which produce in
nations, creeds, and systems, health and disease, growth, change,
decay and death.&nbsp; If, in one small corner of this vast
field, I shall have thrown a single ray of light upon these
subjects&mdash;if I shall have done anything in these pages
towards illustrating the pathology of a single people, I shall
believe that I have done better service to the Catholic Faith and
the Scriptures, than if I did really &ldquo;know the times and
the seasons, which the Father has kept in His own
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; For by the former act I may have helped to
make some one man more prudent and brave to see and to do what
God requires of him; by the latter I could only add to that
paralysis of superstitious fear, which is already but too common
among us, and but too likely to hinder us from doing our duty
manfully against our real foes, whether it be pestilence at home
or tyranny abroad.</p>
<p>These last words lead me to another subject, on which I am
bound to say a few words.&nbsp; I have, at the end of these
Lectures, made some allusion to the present war.&nbsp; To have
entered further into political questions would have been improper
in the place where those Lectures were delivered: but I cannot
refrain from saying here something more on this matter; and that,
first, because all political questions have their real root in
moral and spiritual ones, and not (as too many fancy) in
questions merely relating to the balance of power or commercial
economy, and are (the world being under the guidance of a
spiritual, and not a physical Being) finally decided on those
spiritual grounds, and according to the just laws of the kingdom
of God; and, therefore, the future political horoscope of the
East depends entirely on the present spiritual state of its
inhabitants, and of us who have (and rightly) taken up their
cause; in short, on many of those questions on which I have
touched in these Lectures: and next, because I feel bound, in
justice to myself, to guard against any mistake about my meaning
or supposition that I consider the Turkish empire a righteous
thing, or one likely to stand much longer on the face of
God&rsquo;s earth.</p>
<p>The Turkish empire, as it now exists, seems to me an
altogether unrighteous and worthless thing.&nbsp; It stands no
longer upon the assertion of the great truth of Islam, but on the
merest brute force and oppression.&nbsp; It has long since lost
the only excuse which one race can have for holding another in
subjection; that which we have for taking on ourselves the
tutelage of the Hindoos, and which Rome had for its tutelage of
the Syrians and Egyptians; namely, the governing with tolerable
justice those who cannot govern themselves, and making them
better and more prosperous people, by compelling them to submit
to law.&nbsp; I do not know when this excuse is a sufficient
one.&nbsp; God showed that it was so for several centuries in the
case of the Romans; God will show whether it is in the case of
our Indian empire: but this I say, that the Turkish empire has
not even that excuse to plead; as is proved by the patent fact
that the whole East, the very garden of the old world, has become
a desert and a ruin under the upas-blight of their
government.</p>
<p>As for the regeneration of Turkey, it is a question whether
the regeneration of any nation which has sunk, not into mere
valiant savagery, but into effete and profligate luxury, is
possible.&nbsp; Still more is it a question whether a
regeneration can be effected, not by the rise of a new spiritual
idea (as in the case of the Koreish), but simply by more perfect
material appliances, and commercial prudence.&nbsp; History gives
no instance, it seems to me, of either case; and if our attempt
to regenerate Greece by freeing it has been an utter failure,
much more, it seems to me, would any such attempt fail in the
case of the Turkish race.&nbsp; For what can be done with a
people which has lost the one great quality which was the tenure
of its existence, its military skill?&nbsp; Let any one read the
accounts of the Turkish armies in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and
seventeenth centuries, when they were the tutors and models of
all Europe in the art of war, and then consider the fact that
those very armies require now to be officered by foreign
adventurers, in order to make them capable of even keeping
together, and let him ask himself seriously, whether such a fall
can ever be recovered.&nbsp; When, in the age of Theodosius, and
again in that of Justinian, the Roman armies had fallen into the
same state; when the Italian legions required to be led by
Stilicho the Vandal, and the Byzantine by Belisar the Sclav and
Narses the Persian, the end of all things was at hand, and came;
as it will come soon to Turkey.</p>
<p>But if Turkey deserves to fall, and must fall, it must not
fall by our treachery.&nbsp; Its sins will surely be avenged upon
it: but wrong must not avenge wrong, or the penalty is only
passed on from one sinner to another.&nbsp; Whatsoever element of
good is left in the Turk, to that we must appeal as our only
means, if not of saving him, still of helping him to a quiet
euthanasia, and absorption into a worthier race of
successors.&nbsp; He is said (I know not how truly) to have one
virtue left; that of faithfulness to his word.&nbsp; Only by
showing him that we too abhor treachery and bad faith, can we
either do him good, or take a safe standing-ground in our own
peril.&nbsp; And this we have done; and for this we shall be
rewarded.&nbsp; But this is surely not all our duty.&nbsp; Even
if we should be able to make the civil and religious freedom of
the Eastern Christians the price of our assistance to the
Mussulman, the struggle will not be over; for Russia will still
be what she has always been, and the northern Anarch will be
checked, only to return to the contest with fiercer lust of
aggrandisement, to enact the part of a new Macedon, against a new
Greece, divided, not united, by the treacherous bond of that
balance of power, which is but war under the guise of
peace.&nbsp; Europe needs a holier and more spiritual, and
therefore a stronger union, than can be given by armed
neutralities, and the so-called cause of order.&nbsp; She needs
such a bond as in the Elizabethan age united the free states of
Europe against the Anarch of Spain, and delivered the Western
nations from a rising world-tyranny, which promised to be even
more hideous than the elder one of Rome.&nbsp; If, as then,
England shall proclaim herself the champion of freedom by acts,
and not by words and paper, she may, as she did then, defy the
rulers of the darkness of this world, for the God of Light will
be with her.&nbsp; But, as yet, it is impossible to look without
sad forebodings upon the destiny of a war, begun upon the express
understanding that evil shall be left triumphant throughout
Europe, wheresoever that evil does not seem, to our own selfish
short-sightedness, to threaten us with immediate danger; with
promises, that under the hollow name of the Cause of
Order&mdash;and that promise made by a revolutionary
Anarch&mdash;the wrongs of Italy, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, shall
remain unredressed, and that Prussia and Austria, two tyrannies,
the one far more false and hypocritical, the other even more
rotten than that of Turkey, shall, if they will but observe a
hollow and uncertain neutrality (for who can trust the liar and
the oppressor?)&mdash;be allowed not only to keep their
ill-gotten spoils, but even now to play into the hands of our
foe, by guarding his Polish frontier for him, and keeping down
the victims of his cruelty, under pretence of keeping down those
of their own.</p>
<p>It is true, the alternative is an awful one; one from which
statesmen and nations may well shrink: but it is a question,
whether that alternative may not be forced upon us sooner or
later, whether we must not from the first look it boldly in the
face, as that which must be some day, and for which we must
prepare, not cowardly, and with cries about God&rsquo;s wrath and
judgments against us&mdash;which would be abject, were they not
expressed in such second-hand stock-phrases as to make one
altogether doubt their sincerity, but chivalrously, and with
awful joy, as a noble calling, an honour put upon us by the God
of Nations, who demands of us, as some small return for all His
free bounties, that we should be, in this great crisis, the
champions of Freedom and of Justice, which are the cause of
God.&nbsp; At all events, we shall not escape our duty by being
afraid of it; we shall not escape our duty by inventing to
ourselves some other duty, and calling it
&ldquo;Order.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elizabeth did so at first.&nbsp; She
tried to keep the peace with Spain; she shrank from injuring the
cause of Order (then a nobler one than now, because it was the
cause of Loyalty, and not merely of Mammon) by assisting the
Scotch and the Netherlanders: but her duty was forced upon her;
and she did it at last, cheerfully, boldly, utterly, like a hero;
she put herself at the head of the battle for the freedom of the
world, and she conquered, for God was with her; and so that
seemingly most fearful of all England&rsquo;s perils, when the
real meaning of it was seen, and God&rsquo;s will in it obeyed
manfully, became the foundation of England&rsquo;s naval and
colonial empire, and laid the foundation of all her future
glories.&nbsp; So it was then, so it is now; so it will be for
ever: he who seeks to save his life will lose it: he who
willingly throws away his life for the cause of mankind, which is
the cause of God, the Father of mankind, he shall save it, and be
rewarded a hundred-fold.&nbsp; That God may grant us, the
children of the Elizabethan heroes, all wisdom to see our duty,
and courage to do it, even to the death, should be our earliest
prayer.&nbsp; Our statesmen have done wisely and well in
refusing, in spite of hot-headed clamours, to appeal to the sword
as long as there was any chance of a peaceful settlement even of
a single evil.&nbsp; They are doing wisely and well now in
declining to throw away the scabbard as long as there is hope
that a determined front will awe the offender into submission:
but the day may come when the scabbard must be thrown away; and
God grant that they may have the courage to do it.</p>
<p>It is reported that our rulers have said, that English
diplomacy can no longer recognise &ldquo;nationalities,&rdquo;
but only existing &ldquo;governments.&rdquo;&nbsp; God grant that
they may see in time that the assertion of national life, as a
spiritual and indefeasible existence, was for centuries the
central idea of English policy; the idea by faith in which she
delivered first herself, and then the Protestant nations of the
Continent, successively from the yokes of Rome, of Spain, of
France; and that they may reassert that most English of all
truths again, let the apparent cost be what it may.</p>
<p>It is true, that this end will not be attained without what is
called nowadays &ldquo;a destruction of human life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But we have yet to learn (at least if the doctrines which I have
tried to illustrate in this little book have any truth in them)
whether shot or shell has the power of taking away human life;
and to believe, if we believe our Bibles, that human life can
only be destroyed by sin, and that all which is lost in battle is
that animal life of which it is written, &ldquo;Fear not those
who can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can
do: but I will forewarn you whom you shall fear; him who, after
he has killed, has power to destroy both body and soul in
hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let a man fear him, the destroying devil, and
fear therefore cowardice, disloyalty, selfishness, sluggishness,
which are his works, and to be utterly afraid of which is to be
truly brave.&nbsp; God grant that we of the clergy may remember
this during the coming war, and instead of weakening the
righteous courage and honour of our countrymen by instilling into
them selfish and superstitious fears, and a theory of the future
state which represents God, not as a saviour, but a tormentor,
may boldly tell them that &ldquo;He is not the God of the dead
but of the living; for all live unto Him;&rdquo; and that he who
renders up his animal life as a worthless thing, in the cause of
duty, commits his real and human life, his very soul and self,
into the hands of a just and merciful Father, who has promised to
leave no good deed unrewarded, and least of all that most noble
deed, the dying like a man for the sake not merely of this land
of England, but of the freedom and national life of half the
world.</p>
<h2>LECTURE I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PTOLEMAIC ERA.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> I begin to lecture upon the
Physical and Metaphysical schools of Alexandria, it may be
better, perhaps, to define the meaning of these two
epithets.&nbsp; Physical, we shall all agree, means that which
belongs to &phi;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;; <i>natura</i>;
nature, that which &phi;&#973;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;,
<i>nascitur</i>, grows, by an organic life, and therefore decays
again; which has a beginning, and therefore, I presume, an
end.&nbsp; And Metaphysical means that which we learn to think of
after we think of nature; that which is supernatural, in fact,
having neither beginning nor end, imperishable, immovable, and
eternal, which does not become, but always is.&nbsp; These, at
least, are the wisest definitions of these two terms for us just
now; for they are those which were received by the whole
Alexandrian school, even by those commentators who say that
Aristotle, the inventor of the term Metaphysics, named his
treatise so only on account of its following in philosophic
sequence his book on Physics.</p>
<p>But, according to these definitions, the whole history of
Alexandria might be to us, from one point of view, a physical
school; for Alexandria, its society and its philosophy, were
born, and grew, and fed, and reached their vigour, and had their
old age, their death, even as a plant or an animal has; and after
they were dead and dissolved, the atoms of them formed food for
new creations, entered into new organisations, just as the atoms
of a dead plant or animal might do.&nbsp; Was Alexandria then,
from beginning to end, merely a natural and physical
phenomenon?</p>
<p>It may have been.&nbsp; And yet we cannot deny that Alexandria
was also a metaphysical phenomenon, vast and deep enough; seeing
that it held for some eighteen hundred years a population of
several hundred thousand souls; each of whom, at least according
to the Alexandrian philosophy, stood in a very intimate relation
to those metaphysic things which are imperishable and immovable
and eternal, and indeed, contained them more or less, each man,
woman, and child of them in themselves; having wills, reasons,
consciences, affections, relations to each other; being parents,
children, helpmates, bound together by laws concerning right and
wrong, and numberless other unseen and spiritual relations.</p>
<p>Surely such a body was not merely natural, any more than any
other nation, society, or scientific school, made up of men and
of the spirits, thoughts, affections of men.&nbsp; It, like them,
was surely spiritual; and could be only living and healthy, in as
far as it was in harmony with certain spiritual, unseen, and
everlasting laws of God; perhaps, as certain Alexandrian
philosophers would have held, in as far as it was a pattern of
that ideal constitution and polity after which man was created,
the city of God which is eternal in the Heavens.&nbsp; If so, may
we not suspect of this Alexandria that it was its own fault if it
became a merely physical phenomenon; and that it stooped to
become a part of nature, and took its place among the things
which are born to die, only by breaking the law which God had
appointed for it; so fulfilling, in its own case, St.
Paul&rsquo;s great words, that death entered into the world by
sin, and that sin is the transgression of the law?</p>
<p>Be that as it may, there must have been metaphysic enough to
be learnt in that, or any city of three hundred thousand
inhabitants, even though it had never contained lecture-room or
philosopher&rsquo;s chair, and had never heard the names of
Aristotle and Plato.&nbsp; Metaphysic enough, indeed, to be
learnt there, could we but enter into the heart of even the most
brutish negro slave who ever was brought down the Nile out of the
desert by Nubian merchants, to build piers and docks in whose
commerce he did not share, temples whose worship he did not
comprehend, libraries and theatres whose learning and
civilisation were to him as much a sealed book as they were to
his countryman, and fellow-slave, and only friend, the ape.&nbsp;
There was metaphysic enough in him truly, and things eternal and
immutable, though his dark-skinned descendants were three hundred
years in discovering the fact, and in proving it satisfactorily
to all mankind for ever.&nbsp; You must pardon me if I seem
obscure; I cannot help looking at the question with a somewhat
Alexandrian eye, and talking of the poor negro dock-worker as
certain Alexandrian philosophers would have talked, of whom I
shall have to speak hereafter.</p>
<p>I should have been glad, therefore, had time permitted me,
instead of confining myself strictly to what are now called
&ldquo;the physic and metaphysic schools&rdquo; of Alexandria, to
have tried as well as I could to make you understand how the
whole vast phenomenon grew up, and supported a peculiar life of
its own, for fifteen hundred years and more, and was felt to be
the third, perhaps the second city of the known world, and one so
important to the great world-tyrant, the C&aelig;sar of Rome,
that no Roman of distinction was ever sent there as prefect, but
the Alexandrian national vanity and pride of race was allowed to
the last to pet itself by having its tyrant chosen from its own
people.</p>
<p>But, though this cannot be, we may find human elements enough
in the schools of Alexandria, strictly so called, to interest us
for a few evenings; for these schools were schools of men; what
was discovered and taught was discovered and taught by men, and
not by thinking-machines; and whether they would have been
inclined to confess it or not, their own personal characters,
likes and dislikes, hopes and fears, strength and weakness,
beliefs and disbeliefs, determined their metaphysics and their
physics for them, quite enough to enable us to feel for them as
men of like passions with ourselves; and for that reason only,
men whose thoughts and speculations are worthy of a
moment&rsquo;s attention from us.&nbsp; For what is really
interesting to man, save men, and God, the Father of men?</p>
<p>In the year 331 <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> one of the
greatest intellects whose influence the world has ever felt, saw,
with his eagle glance, the unrivalled advantage of the spot which
is now Alexandria; and conceived the mighty project of making it
the point of union of two, or rather of three worlds.&nbsp; In a
new city, named after himself, Europe, Asia, and Africa were to
meet and to hold communion.&nbsp; A glance at the map will show
you what an &#8000;&mu;&phi;&alpha;&lambda;&#8056;&sigmaf;
&gamma;&#8134;&sigmaf;, a centre of the world, this Alexandria
is, and perhaps arouse in your minds, as it has often done in
mine, the suspicion that it has not yet fulfilled its whole
destiny, but may become at any time a prize for contending
nations, or the centre of some world-wide empire to come.&nbsp;
Communicating with Europe and the Levant by the Mediterranean,
with India by the Red Sea, certain of boundless supplies of food
from the desert-guarded valley of the Nile, to which it formed
the only key, thus keeping all Egypt, as it were, for its own
private farm, it was weak only on one side, that of Judea.&nbsp;
That small strip of fertile mountain land, containing innumerable
military positions from which an enemy might annoy Egypt, being,
in fact, one natural chain of fortresses, was the key to
Phoenicia and Syria.&nbsp; It was an eagle&rsquo;s eyrie by the
side of a pen of fowls.&nbsp; It must not be left defenceless for
a single year.&nbsp; Tyre and Gaza had been taken; so no danger
was to be apprehended from the seaboard: but to subdue the Judean
mountaineers, a race whose past sufferings had hardened them in a
dogged fanaticism of courage and endurance, would be a long and
sanguinary task.&nbsp; It was better to make terms with them; to
employ them as friendly warders of their own mountain
walls.&nbsp; Their very fanaticism and isolation made them sure
allies.&nbsp; There was no fear of their fraternising with the
Eastern invaders.&nbsp; If the country was left in their hands,
they would hold it against all comers.&nbsp; Terms were made with
them; and for several centuries they fulfilled their trust.</p>
<p>This I apprehend to be the explanation of that conciliatory
policy of Alexander&rsquo;s toward the Jews, which was pursued
steadily by the Ptolemies, by Pompey, and by the Romans, as long
as these same Jews continued to be endurable upon the face of the
land.&nbsp; At least, we shall find the history of Alexandria and
that of Judea inextricably united for more than three hundred
years.</p>
<p>So arose, at the command of the great conqueror, a mighty
city, around those two harbours, of which the western one only is
now in use.&nbsp; The Pharos was then an island.&nbsp; It was
connected with the mainland by a great mole, furnished with forts
and drawbridges.&nbsp; On the ruins of that mole now stands the
greater part of the modern city; the vast site of the ancient one
is a wilderness.</p>
<p>But Alexander was not destined to carry out his own
magnificent project.&nbsp; That was left for the general whom he
most esteemed, and to whose personal prowess he had once owed his
life; a man than whom history knows few greater, Ptolemy, the son
of Lagus.&nbsp; He was an adventurer, the son of an adventurer,
his mother a cast-off concubine of Philip of Macedon.&nbsp; There
were those who said that he was in reality a son of Philip
himself.&nbsp; However, he rose at court, became a private friend
of young Alexander, and at last his Somatophylax, some sort of
Colonel of the Life Guards.&nbsp; And from thence he rose
rapidly, till after his great master&rsquo;s death he found
himself despot of Egypt.</p>
<p>His face, as it appears on his coins, is of the loftiest and
most Jove-like type of Greek beauty.&nbsp; There is a possibility
about it, as about most old Greek faces, of boundless cunning; a
lofty irony too, and a contemptuousness, especially about the
mouth, which puts one in mind of Goethe&rsquo;s expression; the
face, altogether, of one who knew men too well to respect
them.&nbsp; At least, he was a man of clear enough vision.&nbsp;
He saw what was needed in those strange times, and he went
straight to the thing which he saw.&nbsp; It was his wisdom which
perceived that the huge amorphous empire of Alexander could not
be kept together, and advised its partition among the generals,
taking care to obtain himself the lion&rsquo;s share; not in
size, indeed, but in capability.&nbsp; He saw, too (what every
man does not see), that the only way to keep what he had got was
to make it better, and not worse, than he found it.&nbsp; His
first Egyptian act was to put to death Cleomenes,
Alexander&rsquo;s lieutenant, who had amassed vast treasures by
extortion; and who was, moreover, (for Ptolemy was a prudent man)
a dangerous partisan of his great enemy, Perdiccas.&nbsp; We do
not read that he refunded the treasures: but the Egyptians
surnamed him Soter, the Saviour; and on the whole he deserved the
title.&nbsp; Instead of the wretched misrule and slavery of the
conquering Persian dynasty, they had at least law and order,
reviving commerce, and a system of administration, we are told (I
confess to speaking here quite at second-hand), especially
adapted to the peculiar caste-society, and the religious
prejudices of Egypt.&nbsp; But Ptolemy&rsquo;s political genius
went beyond such merely material and Warburtonian care for the
conservation of body and goods of his subjects.&nbsp; He effected
with complete success a feat which has been attempted, before and
since, by very many princes and potentates, but has always,
except in Ptolemy&rsquo;s case, proved somewhat of a failure,
namely, the making a new deity.&nbsp; Mythology in general was in
a rusty state.&nbsp; The old Egyptian gods had grown in his
dominions very unfashionable, under the summary iconoclasm to
which they had been subjected by the Monotheist
Persians&mdash;the Puritans of the old world, as they have been
well called.&nbsp; Indeed, all the dolls, and the treasure of the
dolls&rsquo; temples too, had been carried off by Cambyses to
Babylon.&nbsp; And as for the Greek gods, philosophers had
sublimed them away sadly during the last century: not to mention
that Alexander&rsquo;s Macedonians, during their wanderings over
the world, had probably become rather remiss in their religious
exercises, and had possibly given up mentioning the Unseen world,
except for those hortatory purposes for which it used to be
employed by Nelson&rsquo;s veterans.&nbsp; But, as Ptolemy felt,
people (women especially) must have something wherein to
believe.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Religious Sentiment&rdquo; in man must
be satisfied.&nbsp; But, how to do it? How to find a deity who
would meet the aspirations of conquerors as well as
conquered&mdash;of his most irreligious Macedonians, as well as
of his most religious Egyptians?&nbsp; It was a great problem:
but Ptolemy solved it.&nbsp; He seems to have taken the same
method which Brindley the engineer used in his perplexities, for
he went to bed.&nbsp; And there he had a dream: How the foreign
god Serapis, of Pontus (somewhere near this present hapless
Sinope), appeared to him, and expressed his wish to come to
Alexandria, and there try his influence on the Religious
Sentiment.&nbsp; So Serapis was sent for, and came&mdash;at least
the idol of him, and&mdash;accommodating personage!&mdash;he
actually fitted.&nbsp; After he had been there awhile, he was
found to be quite an old acquaintance&mdash;to be, in fact, the
Greek Jove, and two or three other Greek gods, and also two or
three Egyptian gods beside&mdash;indeed, to be no other than the
bull Apis, after his death and deification.&nbsp; I can tell you
no more.&nbsp; I never could find that anything more was
known.&nbsp; You may see him among Greek and Roman statues as a
young man, with a sort of high basket-shaped Persian turban on
his head.&nbsp; But, at least, he was found so pleasant and
accommodating a conscience-keeper, that he spread, with Isis, his
newly-found mother, or wife, over the whole East, and even to
Rome.&nbsp; The Consuls there&mdash;50 years <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>&mdash;found the pair not too
respectable, and pulled down their temples.&nbsp; But, so popular
were they, in spite of their bad fame, that seven years after,
the Triumvirs had to build the temples up again elsewhere; and
from that time forth, Isis and Serapis, in spite, poor things, of
much persecution, were the fashionable deities of the Roman
world.&nbsp; Surely this Ptolemy was a man of genius!</p>
<p>But Ptolemy had even more important work to do than making
gods.&nbsp; He had to make men; for he had few or none ready made
among his old veterans from Issus and Arbela.&nbsp; He had no
hereditary aristocracy: and he wanted none.&nbsp; No aristocracy
of wealth; that might grow of itself, only too fast for his
despotic power.&nbsp; But as a despot, he must have a knot of men
round him who would do his work.&nbsp; And here came out his deep
insight into fact.&nbsp; It had not escaped that man, what was
the secret of Greek supremacy.&nbsp; How had he come there?&nbsp;
How had his great master conquered half the world?&nbsp; How had
the little semi-barbarous mountain tribe up there in Pella, risen
under Philip to be the master-race of the globe? How, indeed, had
Xenophon and his Ten Thousand, how had the handfuls of Salamis
and Marathon, held out triumphantly century after century,
against the vast weight of the barbarian?&nbsp; The simple answer
was: Because the Greek has mind, the barbarian mere brute
force.&nbsp; Because mind is the lord of matter; because the
Greek being the cultivated man, is the only true man; the rest
are &beta;&#8049;&rho;&beta;&alpha;&rho;&omicron;&iota;, mere
things, clods, tools for the wise Greeks&rsquo; use, in spite of
all their material phantom-strength of elephants, and treasures,
and tributaries by the million.&nbsp; Mind was the secret of
Greek power; and for that Ptolemy would work.&nbsp; He would have
an aristocracy of intellect; he would gather round him the wise
men of the world (glad enough most of them to leave that
miserable Greece, where every man&rsquo;s life was in his hand
from hour to hour), and he would develop to its highest the
conception of Philip, when he made Aristotle the tutor of his son
Alexander.&nbsp; The consequences of that attempt were written in
letters of blood, over half the world; Ptolemy would attempt it
once more, with gentler results.&nbsp; For though he fought long,
and often, and well, as Despot of Egypt, no less than as general
of Alexander, he was not at heart a man of blood, and made peace
the end of all his wars.</p>
<p>So he begins.&nbsp; Aristotle is gone: but in
Aristotle&rsquo;s place Philetas the sweet singer of Cos, and
Zenodotus the grammarian of Ephesus, shall educate his favourite
son, and he will have a literary court, and a literary age.&nbsp;
Demetrius Phalereus, the Admirable Crichton of his time, the last
of Attic orators, statesman, philosopher, poet, warrior, and each
of them in the most graceful, insinuating, courtly way, migrates
to Alexandria, after having had the three hundred and sixty
statues, which the Athenians had too hastily erected to his
honour, as hastily pulled down again.&nbsp; Here was a prize for
Ptolemy!&nbsp; The charming man became his bosom friend and
fellow, even revised the laws of his kingdom, and fired him, if
report says true, with a mighty thought&mdash;no less a one than
the great public Library of Alexandria; the first such
institution, it is said, which the world had ever seen.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>So a library is begun by Soter, and organised and completed by
Philadelphus; or rather two libraries, for while one part was
kept at the Serapeium, that vast temple on the inland rising
ground, of which, as far as we can discover, Pompey&rsquo;s
Pillar alone remains, one column out of four hundred, the rest
was in the Brucheion adjoining the Palace and the Museum.&nbsp;
Philadelphus buys Aristotle&rsquo;s collection to add to the
stock, and Euergetes cheats the Athenians out of the original
MSS. of &AElig;schylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, and adds
largely to it by more honest methods.&nbsp; Eumenes, King of
Pergamus in Asia Minor, fired with emulation, commences a similar
collection, and is so successful, that the reigning Ptolemy has
to cut off his rival&rsquo;s supplies by prohibiting the
exportation of papyrus; and the Pergamenian books are henceforth
transcribed on parchment, parchemin, Pergamene, which thus has
its name to this day, from Pergamus.&nbsp; That collection, too,
found its way at last to Alexandria.&nbsp; For Antony having
become possessor of it by right of the stronger, gave it to
Cleopatra; and it remained at Alexandria for seven hundred
years.&nbsp; But we must not anticipate events.</p>
<p>Then there must be besides a Mouseion, a Temple of the Muses,
with all due appliances, in a vast building adjoining the palace
itself, under the very wing of royalty; and it must have
porticos, wherein sages may converse; lecture-rooms, where they
may display themselves at their will to their rapt scholars, each
like a turkey-cock before his brood; and a large dining-hall,
where they may enjoy themselves in moderation, as befits sages,
not without puns and repartees, epigrams, anagrams, and Attic
salt, to be fatal, alas, to poor Diodorus the dialectician.&nbsp;
For Stilpo, prince of sophists, having silenced him by some
quibbling puzzle of logic, Ptolemy surnamed him Chronos the
Slow.&nbsp; Poor Diodorus went home, took pen and ink, wrote a
treatise on the awful nothing, and died in despair, leaving five
&ldquo;dialectical daughters&rdquo; behind him, to be thorns in
the sides of some five hapless men of Macedonia, as
&ldquo;emancipated women;&rdquo; a class but too common in the
later days of Greece, as they will always be, perhaps, in
civilisations which are decaying and crumbling to pieces, leaving
their members to seek in bewilderment what they are, and what
bonds connect them with their fellow-beings.&nbsp; But to return:
funds shall be provided for the Museum from the treasury; a
priest of rank, appointed by royalty, shall be curator; botanical
and zoological gardens shall be attached; collections of wonders
made.&nbsp; In all things the presiding genius of Aristotle shall
be worshipped; for these, like Alexander, were his pupils.&nbsp;
Had he not mapped out all heaven and earth, things seen and
unseen, with his entelechies, and energies, and dunameis, and put
every created and uncreated thing henceforth into its proper
place, from the ascidians and polypes of the sea to the virtues
and the vices&mdash;yea, to that Great Deity and Prime Cause
(which indeed was all things), <i>Noesis Noeseon</i>, &ldquo;the
Thought of Thoughts,&rdquo; whom he discovered by irrefragable
processes of logic, and in whom the philosophers believe
privately, leaving Serapis to the women and the sailors?&nbsp;
All they had to do was to follow in his steps; to take each of
them a branch, of science or literature, or as many branches as
one man conveniently can; and working them out on the approved
methods, end in a few years, as Alexander did, by weeping on the
utmost shore of creation that there are no more worlds left to
conquer.</p>
<p>Alas! the Muses are shy and wild; and though they will haunt,
like skylarks, on the bleakest northern moor as cheerfully as on
the sunny hills of Greece, and rise thence singing into the
heaven of heavens, yet they are hard to tempt into a gilded cage,
however amusingly made and plentifully stored with
comforts.&nbsp; Royal societies, associations of savants, and the
like, are good for many things, but not for the breeding of art
and genius: for they are things which cannot be bred.&nbsp; Such
institutions are excellent for physical science, when, as among
us now, physical science is going on the right method: but where,
as in Alexandria, it was going on an utterly wrong method, they
stereotype the errors of the age, and invest them with the
prestige of authority, and produce mere Sorbonnes, and schools of
pedants.&nbsp; To literature, too, they do some good, that is, in
a literary age&mdash;an age of reflection rather than of
production, of antiquarian research, criticism, imitation, when
book-making has become an easy and respectable pursuit for the
many who cannot dig, and are ashamed to beg.&nbsp; And yet, by
adding that same prestige of authority, not to mention of good
society and Court favour, to the popular mania for literature,
they help on the growing evil, and increase the multitude of
prophets who prophesy out of their own heart and have seen
nothing.</p>
<p>And this was, it must be said, the outcome of all the
Ptolem&aelig;an appliances.</p>
<p>In Physics they did little.&nbsp; In Art nothing.&nbsp; In
Metaphysics less than nothing.</p>
<p>We will first examine, as the more pleasant spectacle of the
two, that branch of thought in which some progress was really
made, and in which the Ptolemaic schools helped forward the
development of men who have become world-famous, and will remain
so, I suppose, until the end of time.</p>
<p>Four names at once attract us: Euclid, Aristarchus,
Eratosthenes, Hipparchus.&nbsp; Archimedes, also, should be
included in the list, for he was a pupil of the Alexandrian
school, having studied (if Proclus is to be trusted) in Egypt,
under Conon the Samian, during the reigns of two Ptolemies,
Philadelphus and Euergetes.</p>
<p>Of Euclid, as the founder (according to Proclus) of the
Alexandrian Mathematical school, I must of course speak
first.&nbsp; Those who wish to attain to a juster conception of
the man and his work than they can do from any other source, will
do well to read Professor De Morgan&rsquo;s admirable article on
him in &ldquo;Smith&rsquo;s Classical Dictionary;&rdquo; which
includes, also, a valuable little sketch of the rise of Geometric
science, from Pythagoras and Plato, of whose school Euclid was,
to the great master himself.</p>
<p>I shall confine myself to one observation on Euclid&rsquo;s
genius, and on the immense influence which it exerted on after
generations.&nbsp; It seems to me, speaking under correction,
that it exerted this, because it was so complete a type of the
general tendency of the Greek mind, deductive, rather than
inductive; of unrivalled subtlety in obtaining results from
principles, and results again from them <i>ad infinitum</i>:
deficient in that sturdy moral patience which is required for the
examination of facts, and which has made Britain at once a land
of practical craftsmen, and of earnest scientific
discoverers.</p>
<p>Volatile, restless, &ldquo;always children longing for
something new,&rdquo; as the Egyptian priest said of them, they
were too ready to believe that they had attained laws, and then,
tired with their toy, throw away those hastily assumed laws, and
wander off in search of others.&nbsp; Gifted, beyond all the sons
of men, with the most exquisite perception of form, both physical
and metaphysical, they could become geometers and logicians as
they became sculptors and artists; beyond that they could hardly
rise.&nbsp; The were conscious of their power to build; and it
made them ashamed to dig.</p>
<p>Four men only among them seem, as far as I can judge, to have
had a great inductive power: Socrates and Plato in Metaphysics;
Archimedes and Hipparchus in Physics.&nbsp; But these men ran so
far counter to the national genius, that their examples were not
followed.&nbsp; As you will hear presently, the discoveries of
Archimedes and Hipparchus were allowed to remain where they were
for centuries.&nbsp; The Dialectic of Plato and Socrates was
degraded into a mere art for making anything appear alternately
true and false, and among the Megaric school, for undermining the
ground of all science, and paving the way for scepticism, by
denying the natural world to be the object of certain
knowledge.&nbsp; The only element of Plato&rsquo;s thought to
which they clung was, as we shall find from the Neoplatonists,
his physical speculations; in which, deserting his inductive
method, he has fallen below himself into the popular cacoethes,
and Pythagorean deductive dreams about the mysterious powers of
numbers, and of the regular solids.</p>
<p>Such a people, when they took to studying physical science,
would be, and in fact were, incapable of Chemistry, Geognosy,
Comparative Anatomy, or any of that noble choir of sister
sciences, which are now building up the material as well as the
intellectual glory of Britain.</p>
<p>To Astronomy, on the other hand, the pupils of Euclid turned
naturally, as to the science which required the greatest amount
of their favourite geometry: but even that they were content to
let pass from its inductive to its deductive stage&mdash;not as
we have done now, after two centuries of inductive search for the
true laws, and their final discovery by Kepler and Newton: but as
soon as Hipparchus had propounded any theory which would do
instead of the true laws, content there to stop their
experiments, and return to their favourite work of commenting,
deducing, spinning notion out of notion, <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>
<p>Still, they were not all of this temper.&nbsp; Had they been,
they would have discovered, not merely a little, but absolutely
nothing.&nbsp; For after all, if we will consider, induction
being the right path to knowledge, every man, whether he knows it
or not, uses induction, more or less, by the mere fact of his
having a human reason, and knowing anything at all; as M.
Jourdain talked prose all his life without being aware of it.</p>
<p>Aristarchus is principally famous for his attempt to discover
the distance of the sun as compared with that of the moon.&nbsp;
His method was ingenious enough, but too rough for success, as it
depended principally on the belief that the line bounding the
bright part of the moon was an exact straight line.&nbsp; The
result was of course erroneous.&nbsp; He concluded that the sun
was 18 times as far as the moon, and not, as we now know, 400;
but his conclusion, like his conception of the vast extent of the
sphere of the fixed stars, was far enough in advance of the
popular doctrine to subject him, according to Plutarch, to a
charge of impiety.</p>
<p>Eratosthenes, again, contributed his mite to the treasure of
human science&mdash;his one mite; and yet by that he is better
known than by all the volumes which he seems to have poured out,
on Ethics, Chronology, Criticism on the Old Attic Comedy, and
what not, spun out of his weary brain during a long life of
research and meditation.&nbsp; They have all perished,&mdash;like
ninety-nine hundredths of the labours of that great literary age;
and perhaps the world is no poorer for the loss.&nbsp; But one
thing, which he attempted on a sound and practical philosophic
method, stands, and will stand for ever.&nbsp; And after all, is
not that enough to have lived for? to have found out one true
thing, and, therefore, one imperishable thing, in one&rsquo;s
life?&nbsp; If each one of us could but say when he died:
&ldquo;This one thing I have found out; this one thing I have
proved to be possible; this one eternal fact I have rescued from
Hela, the realm of the formless and unknown,&rdquo; how rich one
such generation might make the world for ever!</p>
<p>But such is not the appointed method.&nbsp; The finders are
few and far between, because the true seekers are few and far
between; and a whole generation has often nothing to show for its
existence but one solitary gem which some one man&mdash;often
unnoticed in his time&mdash;has picked up for them, and so given
them &ldquo;a local habitation and a name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eratosthenes had heard that in Syene, in Upper Egypt, deep
wells were enlightened to the bottom on the day of the summer
solstice, and that vertical objects cast no shadows.</p>
<p>He had before suggested, as is supposed, to Ptolemy Euergetes,
to make him the two great copper armill&aelig;, or circles for
determining the equinox, which stood for centuries in &ldquo;that
which is called the Square Porch&rdquo;&mdash;probably somewhere
in the Museum.&nbsp; By these he had calculated the obliquity of
the ecliptic, closely enough to serve for a thousand years
after.&nbsp; That was one work done.&nbsp; But what had the Syene
shadows to do with that?&nbsp; Syene must be under that
ecliptic.&nbsp; On the edge of it.&nbsp; In short, just under the
tropic.&nbsp; Now he had ascertained exactly the latitude of one
place on the earth&rsquo;s surface.&nbsp; He had his known point
from whence to start on a world-journey, and he would use it; he
would calculate the circumference of the earth&mdash;and he did
it.&nbsp; By observations made at Alexandria, he ascertained its
latitude compared with that of Syene; and so ascertained what
proportion to the whole circumference was borne by the 5000
stadia between Alexandria and Syene.&nbsp; He fell into an error,
by supposing Alexandria and Syene to be under the same meridians
of longitude: but that did not prevent his arriving at a fair
rough result of 252,000 stadia&mdash;31,500 Roman miles;
considerably too much; but still, before him, I suppose, none
knew whether it was 10,000, or 10,000,000.&nbsp; The right method
having once been found, nothing remained but to employ it more
accurately.</p>
<p>One other great merit of Eratosthenes is, that he first raised
Geography to the rank of a science.&nbsp; His Geographica were an
organic collection, the first the world had ever seen, of all the
travels and books of earth-description heaped together in the
Great Library, of which he was for many years the keeper.&nbsp;
He began with a geognostic book, touched on the traces of
Cataclysms and Change visible on the earth&rsquo;s surface;
followed by two books, one a mathematical book, the other on
political geography, and completed by a map&mdash;which one would
like to see: but&mdash;not a trace of all remains, save a few
quoted fragments&mdash;</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are such stuff<br />
As dreams are made of.</p>
<p>But if Eratosthenes had hold of eternal fact and law on one
point, there was a contemporary who had hold of it in more than
one.&nbsp; I mean Archimedes; of whom, as I have said, we must
speak as of an Alexandrian.&nbsp; It was as a mechanician, rather
than as an astronomer, that he gained his reputation.&nbsp; The
stories of his Hydraulic Screw, the Great Ship which he built for
Hiero, and launched by means of machinery, his crane, his
war-engines, above all his somewhat mythical arrangement of
mirrors, by which he set fire to ships in the harbour&mdash;all
these, like the story of his detecting the alloy in Hiero&rsquo;s
crown, while he himself was in the bath, and running home
undressed shouting
&epsilon;&#8021;&rho;&eta;&kappa;&alpha;&mdash;all these are
schoolboys&rsquo; tales.&nbsp; To the thoughtful person it is the
method of the man which constitutes his real greatness, that
power of insight by which he solved the two great problems of the
nature of the lever and of hydrostatic pressure, which form the
basis of all static and hydrostatic science to this day.&nbsp;
And yet on that very question of the lever the great mind of
Aristotle babbles&mdash;neither sees the thing itself, nor the
way towards seeing it.&nbsp; But since Archimedes spoke, the
thing seems self-evident to every schoolboy.&nbsp; There is
something to me very solemn in such a fact as this.&nbsp; It
brings us down to some of the very deepest questions of
metaphysic.&nbsp; This mental insight of which we boast so much,
what is it?&nbsp; Is it altogether a process of our own brain and
will?&nbsp; If it be, why have so few the power, even among men
of power, and they so seldom?&nbsp; If brain alone were what was
wanted, what could not Aristotle have discovered?&nbsp; Or is it
that no man can see a thing unless God shows it him?&nbsp; Is it
that in each separate act of induction, that mysterious and
transcendental process which cannot, let logicians try as they
will, be expressed by any merely logical formula, Aristotelian or
other&mdash;is it I say, that in each separate act of induction
we do not find the law, but the law is shown to us, by Him who
made the law? Bacon thought so.&nbsp; Of that you may find clear
proof in his writings.&nbsp; May not Bacon be right?&nbsp; May it
not be true that God does in science, as well as in ethics, hide
things from the wise and prudent, from the proud, complete,
self-contained systematiser like Aristotle, who must needs
explain all things in heaven and earth by his own formul&aelig;,
and his entelechies and energies, and the rest of the notions
which he has made for himself out of his own brain, and then pack
each thing away in its proper niche in his great cloud-universe
of conceptions?&nbsp; Is it that God hides things from such men
many a time, and reveals them to babes, to gentle, affectionate,
simple-hearted men, such as we know Archimedes to have been, who
do not try to give an explanation for a fact, but feel how awful
and divine it is, and wrestle reverently and stedfastly with it,
as Jacob with the Angel, and will not let it go, until it bless
them?&nbsp; Sure I am, from what I have seen of scientific men,
that there is an intimate connection between the health of the
moral faculties and the health of the inductive ones; and that
the proud, self-conceited, and passionate man will see nothing:
perhaps because nothing will be shown him.</p>
<p>But we must leave Archimedes for a man not perhaps so well
known, but to whom we owe as much as to the great
Syracusan&mdash;Hipparchus the astronomer.&nbsp; To his case much
which I have just said applies.&nbsp; In him astronomic science
seemed to awaken suddenly to a true inductive method, and after
him to fall into its old slumber for 300 years.&nbsp; In the
meantime Timocharis, Aristyllus, and Conon had each added their
mites to the discoveries of Eratosthenes: but to Hipparchus we
owe that theory of the heavens, commonly called the Ptolemaic
system, which, starting from the assumption that the earth was
the centre of the universe, attempted to explain the motions of
the heavenly bodies by a complex system of supposed eccentrics
and epicycles.&nbsp; This has of course now vanished before
modern discoveries.&nbsp; But its value as a scientific attempt
lies in this: that the method being a correct one, correct
results were obtained, though starting from a false assumption;
and Hipparchus and his successors were enabled by it to calculate
and predict the changes of the heavens, in spite of their clumsy
instruments, with almost as much accuracy as we do now.</p>
<p>For the purpose of working out this theory he required a
science of trigonometry, plane and spherical: and this he
accordingly seems to have invented.&nbsp; To him also we owe the
discovery of that vast gradual change in the position of the
fixed stars, in fact, of the whole celestial system, now known by
the name of the precession of the equinoxes; the first great
catalogue of fixed stars, to the number of 1080; attempts to
ascertain whether the length of years and days were constant;
with which, with his characteristic love of truth, he seems to
have been hardly satisfied.&nbsp; He too invented the
planisphere, or mode of representing the starry heavens upon a
plane, and is the father of true geography, having formed the
happy notion of mapping out the earth, as well as the heavens, by
degrees of latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>Strange it is, and somewhat sad, that we should know nothing
of this great man, should be hardly able to distinguish him from
others of the same name, but through the works of a commentator,
who wrote and observed in Alexandria 300 years after, during the
age of the Antonines.&nbsp; I mean, of course, the famous
Ptolemy, whose name so long bore the honour of that system which
really belonged to Hipparchus.</p>
<p>This single fact speaks volumes for the real weakness of the
great artificial school of literature and science founded by the
kings of Egypt.&nbsp; From the father of Astronomy, as Delambre
calls him, to Ptolemy, the first man who seems really to have
appreciated him, we have not a discovery, hardly an observation
or a name, to fill the gap.&nbsp; Physical sages there were; but
they were geometers and mathematicians, rather than astronomic
observers and inquirers.&nbsp; And in spite of all the huge
appliances and advantages of that great Museum, its inhabitants
were content, in physical science, as in all other branches of
thought, to comment, to expound, to do everything but open their
eyes and observe facts, and learn from them, as the predecessors
whom they pretended to honour had done.&nbsp; But so it is
always.&nbsp; A genius, an original man appears.&nbsp; He puts
himself boldly in contact with facts, asks them what they mean,
and writes down their answer for the world&rsquo;s use.&nbsp; And
then his disciples must needs form a school, and a system; and
fancy that they do honour to their master by refusing to follow
in his steps; by making his book a fixed dogmatic canon;
attaching to it some magical infallibility; declaring the very
lie which he disproved by his whole existence, that discovery is
henceforth impossible, and the sum of knowledge complete: instead
of going on to discover as he discovered before them, and in
following his method, show that they honour him, not in the
letter, but in spirit and in truth.</p>
<p>For this, if you will consider, is the true meaning of that
great command, &ldquo;Honour thy father and mother, that thy days
may be long in the land.&rdquo;&nbsp; On reverence for the
authority of bygone generations depends the permanence of every
form of thought or belief, as much as of all social, national,
and family life: but on reverence of the spirit, not merely of
the letter; of the methods of our ancestors, not merely of their
conclusions.&nbsp; Ay, and we shall not be able to preserve their
conclusions, not even to understand them; they will die away on
our lips into skeleton notions, and soulless phrases, unless we
see that the greatness of the mighty dead has always consisted in
this, that they were seekers, improvers, inventors, endued with
that divine power and right of discovery which has been bestowed
on us, even as on them; unless we become such men as they were,
and go on to cultivate and develop the precious heritage which
they have bequeathed to us, instead of hiding their talent in a
napkin and burying it in the earth; making their greatness an
excuse for our own littleness, their industry for our laziness,
their faith for our despair; and prating about the old paths,
while we forget that paths were made that men might walk in them,
and not stand still, and try in vain to stop the way.</p>
<p>It may be said, certainly, as an excuse for these Alexandrian
Greeks, that they were a people in a state of old age and decay;
and that they only exhibited the common and natural faults of old
age.&nbsp; For as with individuals, so with races, nations,
societies, schools of thought&mdash;youth is the time of free
fancy and poetry; manhood of calm and strong induction; old age
of deduction, when men settle down upon their lees, and content
themselves with reaffirming and verifying the conclusions of
their earlier years, and too often, alas! with denying and
anathematising all conclusions which have been arrived at since
their own meridian.&nbsp; It is sad: but it is patent and
common.&nbsp; It is sad to think that the day may come to each of
us, when we shall have ceased to hope for discovery and for
progress; when a thing will seem <i>&agrave; priori</i> false to
us, simply because it is new; and we shall be saying querulously
to the Divine Light which lightens every man who comes into the
world: &ldquo;Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further.&nbsp;
Thou hast taught men enough; yea rather, thou hast exhausted
thine own infinitude, and hast no more to teach
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely such a temper is to be fought against,
prayed against, both in ourselves, and in the generation in which
we live.&nbsp; Surely there is no reason why such a temper should
overtake old age.&nbsp; There may be reason enough, &ldquo;in the
nature of things.&rdquo;&nbsp; For that which is of nature is
born only to decay and die.&nbsp; But in man there is more than
dying nature; there is spirit, and a capability of spiritual and
everlasting life, which renews its youth like the eagle&rsquo;s,
and goes on from strength to strength, and which, if it have its
autumns and its winters, has no less its ever-recurring springs
and summers; if it has its Sabbaths, finds in them only rest and
refreshment for coming labour.&nbsp; And why not in nations,
societies, scientific schools?&nbsp; These too are not merely
natural: they are spiritual, and are only living and healthy in
as far as they are in harmony with spiritual, unseen, and
everlasting laws of God.&nbsp; May not they, too, have a
capability of everlasting life, as long as they obey those laws
in faith, and patience, and humility?&nbsp; We cannot deny the
analogy between the individual man and these societies of
men.&nbsp; We cannot, at least, deny the analogy between them in
growth, decay, and death.&nbsp; May we not have hope that it
holds good also for that which can never die; and that if they do
die, as this old Greek society did, it is by no brute natural
necessity, but by their own unfaithfulness to that which they
knew, to that which they ought to have known?&nbsp; It is always
more hopeful, always, as I think, more philosophic, to throw the
blame of failure on man, on our own selves, rather than on God,
and the perfect law of His universe.&nbsp; At least let us be
sure for ourselves, that such an old age as befell this Greek
society, as befalls many a man nowadays, need not be our
lot.&nbsp; Let us be sure that earth shows no fairer sight than
the old man, whose worn-out brain and nerves make it painful, and
perhaps impossible, to produce fresh thought himself: but who can
yet welcome smilingly and joyfully the fresh thoughts of others;
who keeps unwearied his faith in God&rsquo;s government of the
universe, in God&rsquo;s continual education of the human race;
who draws around him the young and the sanguine, not merely to
check their rashness by his wise cautions, but to inspirit their
sloth by the memories of his own past victories; who hands over,
without envy or repining, the lamp of truth to younger runners
than himself, and sits contented by, bidding the new generation
God speed along the paths untrodden by him, but seen afar off by
faith.&nbsp; A few such old persons have I seen, both men and
women; in whom the young heart beat pure and fresh, beneath the
cautious and practised brain of age, and gray hairs which were
indeed a crown of glory.&nbsp; A few such have I seen; and from
them I seemed to learn what was the likeness of our Father who is
in heaven.&nbsp; To such an old age may He bring you and me, and
all for whom we are bound to pray.</p>
<h2>LECTURE II.<br />
THE PTOLEMAIC ERA.<br />
(<i>Continued</i>.)</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">said</span> in my first Lecture, that
even if royal influence be profitable for the prosecution of
physical science, it cannot be profitable for art.&nbsp; It can
only produce a literary age, as it did in the Ptolemaic era; a
generation of innumerable court-poets, artificial epigrammatists,
artificial idyllists, artificial dramatists and epicists; above
all, a generation of critics.&nbsp; Or rather shall we say, that
the dynasty was not the cause of a literary age, but only its
correlative?&nbsp; That when the old Greeks lost the power of
being free, of being anything but the slaves of oriental despots,
as the Ptolemies in reality were, they lost also the power of
producing true works of art; because they had lost that youthful
vigour of mind from which both art and freedom sprang? Let the
case be as it will, Alexandrian literature need not detain us
long&mdash;though, alas! it has detained every boy who ever
trembled over his Greek grammar, for many a weary year; and, I
cannot help suspecting, has been the main cause that so many
young men who have spent seven years in learning Greek, know
nothing about it at the end of the seven.&nbsp; For I must say,
that as far as we can see, these Alexandrian pedants were
thorough pedants; very polished and learned gentlemen, no doubt,
and, like Callimachus, the pets of princes: but after all, men
who thought that they could make up for not writing great works
themselves, by showing, with careful analysis and commentation,
how men used to write them of old, or rather how they fancied men
used to write them; for, consider, if they had really known how
the thing was done, they must needs have been able to do it
themselves.&nbsp; Thus Callimachus, the favourite of Ptolemy
Philadelphus, and librarian of his Museum, is the most
distinguished grammarian, critic, and poet of his day, and has
for pupils Eratosthenes, Apollonius Rhodius, Aristophanes of
Byzantium, and a goodly list more.&nbsp; He is an
encyclop&aelig;dia in himself.&nbsp; There is nothing the man
does not know, or probably, if we spoke more correctly, nothing
he does not know about.&nbsp; He writes on history, on the
Museum, on barbarous names, on the wonders of the world, on
public games, on colonisation, on winds, on birds, on the rivers
of the world, and&mdash;ominous subject&mdash;a sort of
comprehensive history of Greek literature, with a careful
classification of all authors, each under his own heading.&nbsp;
Greek literature was rather in the sere and yellow leaf, be sure,
when men thought of writing that sort of thing about it.&nbsp;
But still, he is an encyclop&aelig;dic man, and, moreover, a
poet.&nbsp; He writes an epic, &ldquo;Aitia,&rdquo; in four
books, on the causes of the myths, religious ceremonies, and so
forth&mdash;an ominous sign for the myths also, and the belief in
them; also a Hecate, Galat&aelig;a, Glaucus&mdash;four epics,
besides comedies, tragedies, iambics, choriambics, elegies,
hymns, epigrams seventy-three&mdash;and of these last alone can
we say that they are in any degree readable; and they are
courtly, far-fetched, neat, and that is all.&nbsp; Six hymns
remain, and a few fragments of the elegies: but the most famous
elegy, on Berenice&rsquo;s hair, is preserved to us only in a
Latin paraphrase of Catullus.&nbsp; It is curious, as the
earliest instance we have of genuinely ungenuine Court poetry,
and of the complimentary lie which does not even pretend to be
true; the flattery which will not take the trouble to prevent
your seeing that it is laughing in your face.</p>
<p>Berenice the queen, on Ptolemy&rsquo;s departure to the wars,
vows her beautiful tresses to her favourite goddess, as the price
of her husband&rsquo;s safe return; and duly pays her vow.&nbsp;
The hair is hung up in the temple: in a day or two after it has
vanished.&nbsp; Dire is the wrath of Ptolemy, the consternation
of the priests, the scandal to religion; when Conon, the
court-astronomer, luckily searching the heavens, finds the
missing tresses in an utterly unexpected place&mdash;as a new
constellation of stars, which to this day bears the title of Coma
Berenices.&nbsp; It is so convenient to believe the fact, that
everybody believes it accordingly; and Callimachus writes an
elegy thereon, in which the constellified, or indeed deified
tresses, address in most melodious and highly-finished Greek,
bedizened with concetto on concetto, that fair and sacred head
whereon they grew, to be shorn from which is so dire a sorrow,
that apotheosis itself can hardly reconcile them to the
parting.</p>
<p>Worthy, was not all this, of the descendants of the men who
fought at Marathon and Thermopyl&aelig;?&nbsp; The old Greek
civilisation was rotting swiftly down; while a fire of God was
preparing, slowly and dimly, in that unnoticed Italian town of
Rome, which was destined to burn up that dead world, and all its
works.</p>
<p>Callimachus&rsquo;s hymns, those may read who list.&nbsp; They
are highly finished enough; the work of a man who knew thoroughly
what sort of article he intended to make, and what were the most
approved methods of making it.&nbsp; Curious and cumbrous
mythological lore comes out in every other line.&nbsp; The
smartness, the fine epithets, the recondite conceits, the bits of
effect, are beyond all praise; but as for one spark of life, of
poetry, of real belief, you will find none; not even in that
famous Lavacrum Palladis which Angelo Poliziano thought worth
translating into Latin elegiacs, about the same time that the
learned Florentine, Antonio Maria Salviano, found
Berenice&rsquo;s Hair worthy to be paraphrased back from
Catullus&rsquo; Latin into Greek, to give the world some faint
notion of the inestimable and incomparable original.&nbsp; They
must have had much time on their hands.&nbsp; But at the Revival
of Letters, as was to be expected, all works of the ancients,
good and bad, were devoured alike with youthful eagerness by the
Medicis and the Popes; and it was not, we shall see, for more
than one century after, that men&rsquo;s taste got sufficiently
matured to distinguish between Callimachus and the Homeric hymns,
or between Plato and Proclus.&nbsp; Yet Callimachus and his
fellows had an effect on the world.&nbsp; His writings, as well
as those of Philetas, were the model on which Ovid, Propertius,
Tibullus, formed themselves.</p>
<p>And so I leave him, with two hints.&nbsp; If any one wishes to
see the justice of my censure, let him read one of the
Alexandrian hymns, and immediately after it, one of those
glorious old Homeric hymns to the very same deities; let him
contrast the insincere and fulsome idolatry of Callimachus with
the reverent, simple and manful anthropomorphism of the
Homerist&mdash;and let him form his own judgment.</p>
<p>The other hint is this.&nbsp; If Callimachus, the founder of
Alexandrian literature, be such as he is, what are his pupils
likely to become, at least without some infusion of healthier
blood, such as in the case of his Roman imitators produced a new
and not altogether ignoble school?</p>
<p>Of Lycophron, the fellow-grammarian and poet of Callimachus,
we have nothing left but the Cassandra, a long iambic poem,
stuffed with traditionary learning, and so obscure, that it
obtained for him the surname of
&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&#972;&sigmaf;,
the dark one.&nbsp; I have tried in vain to read it: you, if you
will, may do the same.</p>
<p>Philetas, the remaining member of the Alexandrian Triad, seems
to have been a more simple, genial, and graceful spirit than the
other two, to whom he was accordingly esteemed inferior.&nbsp;
Only a few fragments are left; but he was not altogether without
his influence, for he was, as I have just said, one of the models
on which Propertius and Ovid formed themselves; and some, indeed,
call him the Father of the Latin elegy, with its terseness,
grace, and clear epigrammatic form of thought, and, therefore, in
a great degree, of our modern eighteenth century poets; not a
useless excellence, seeing that it is, on the whole, good for him
who writes to see clearly what he wants to say, and to be able to
make his readers see it clearly also.&nbsp; And yet one natural
strain is heard amid all this artificial jingle&mdash;that of
Theocritus.&nbsp; It is not altogether Alexandrian.&nbsp; Its
sweetest notes were learnt amid the chestnut groves and orchards,
the volcanic glens and sunny pastures of Sicily; but the
intercourse, between the courts of Hiero and the Ptolemies seems
to have been continual.&nbsp; Poets and philosophers moved freely
from one to the other, and found a like atmosphere in both; and
in one of Theocritus&rsquo; idyls, two Sicilian gentlemen,
crossed in love, agree to sail for Alexandria, and volunteer into
the army of the great and good king Ptolemy, of whom a sketch is
given worth reading; as a man noble, generous, and stately,
&ldquo;knowing well who loves him, and still better who loves him
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has another encomium on Ptolemy, more
laboured, though not less interesting: but the real value of
Theocritus lies in his power of landscape-painting.</p>
<p>One can well conceive the delight which his idyls must have
given to those dusty Alexandrians, pent up forever between sea
and sand-hills, drinking the tank-water, and never hearing the
sound of a running stream&mdash;whirling, too, forever, in all
the bustle and intrigue of a great commercial and literary
city.&nbsp; Refreshing indeed it must have been to them to hear
of those simple joys and simple sorrows of the Sicilian shepherd,
in a land where toil was but exercise, and mere existence was
enjoyment.&nbsp; To them, and to us also.&nbsp; I believe
Theocritus is one of the poets who will never die.&nbsp; He sees
men and things, in his own light way, truly; and he describes
them simply, honestly, with little careless touches of pathos and
humour, while he floods his whole scene with that gorgeous
Sicilian air, like one of Titian&rsquo;s pictures; with still
sunshine, whispering pines, the lizard sleeping on the wall, and
the sunburnt cicala shrieking on the spray, the pears and apples
dropping from the orchard bough, the goats clambering from crag
to crag after the cistus and the thyme, the brown youths and
wanton lasses singing under the dark chestnut boughs, or by the
leafy arch of some</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grot
nymph-haunted,<br />
Garlanded over with vine, and acanthus, and clambering roses,<br
/>
Cool in the fierce still noon, where the streams glance clear in
the moss-beds;</p>
<p>and here and there, beyond the braes and meads, blue glimpses
of the far-off summer sea; and all this told in a language and a
metre which shapes itself almost unconsciously, wave after wave,
into the most luscious song.&nbsp; Doubt not that many a soul
then, was the simpler, and purer, and better, for reading the
sweet singer of Syracuse.&nbsp; He has his immoralities; but they
are the immoralities of his age: his naturalness, his sunny calm
and cheerfulness, are all his own.</p>
<p>And now, to leave the poets, and speak of those grammarians to
whose corrections we owe, I suppose, the texts of the Greek poets
as they now stand.&nbsp; They seem to have set to work at their
task methodically enough, under the direction of their most
literary monarch, Ptolemy Philadelphus.&nbsp; Alexander the
&AElig;tolian collected and revised the tragedies, Lycophron the
comedies, Zenodotus the poems of Homer, and the other poets of
the Epic cycle, now lost to us.&nbsp; Whether Homer prospered
under all his expungings, alterations, and
transpositions&mdash;whether, in fact, he did not treat Homer
very much as Bentley wanted to treat Milton, is a suspicion which
one has a right to entertain, though it is long past the
possibility of proof.&nbsp; Let that be as it may, the critical
business grew and prospered.&nbsp; Aristophanes of Byzantium
wrote glossaries and grammars, collected editions of Plato and
Aristotle, &aelig;sthetic disquisitions on Homer&mdash;one wishes
they were preserved, for the sake of the jest, that one might
have seen an Alexandrian cockney&rsquo;s views of Achilles and
Ulysses!&nbsp; Moreover, in a hapless moment, at least for us
moderns, he invented Greek accents; thereby, I fear, so
complicating and confusing our notions of Greek rhythm, that we
shall never, to the end of time, be able to guess what any Greek
verse, saving the old Homeric Hexameter, sounded like.&nbsp;
After a while, too, the pedants, according to their wont, began
quarrelling about their accents and their recessions.&nbsp;
Moreover, there was a rival school at Pergamus where the fame of
Crates all but equalled the Egyptian fame of Aristarchus.&nbsp;
Insolent!&nbsp; What right had an Asiatic to know anything?&nbsp;
So Aristarchus flew furiously on Crates, being a man of plain
common sense, who felt a correct reading a far more important
thing than any of Crates&rsquo;s illustrations, &aelig;sthetic,
historical, or mythological; a preference not yet quite extinct,
in one, at least, of our Universities.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
said a clever Cambridge Tutor to a philosophically inclined
freshman, &ldquo;remember, that our business is to translate
Plato correctly, not to discover his meaning.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
paradoxical as it may seem, he was right.&nbsp; Let us first have
accuracy, the merest mechanical accuracy, in every branch of
knowledge.&nbsp; Let us know what the thing is which we are
looking at.&nbsp; Let us know the exact words an author
uses.&nbsp; Let us get at the exact value of each word by that
severe induction of which Buttmann and the great Germans have set
such noble examples; and then, and not till then, we may begin to
talk about philosophy, and &aelig;sthetics, and the rest.&nbsp;
Very Probably Aristarchus was right in his dislike of
Crates&rsquo;s preference of what he called criticism, to
grammar.&nbsp; Very probably he connected it with the other
object of his especial hatred, that fashion of interpreting Homer
allegorically, which was springing up in his time, and which
afterwards under the Neoplatonists rose to a frantic height, and
helped to destroy in them, not only their power of sound
judgment, and of asking each thing patiently what it was, but
also any real reverence for, or understanding of, the very
authors over whom they declaimed and sentimentalised.</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;the Cambridge Tutor was right.&nbsp; Before you can
tell what a man means, you must have patience to find out what he
says.&nbsp; So far from wishing our grammatical and philological
education to be less severe than it is, I think it is not severe
enough.&nbsp; In an age like this&mdash;an age of lectures, and
of popular literature, and of self-culture, too often random and
capricious, however earnest, we cannot be too careful in asking
ourselves, in compelling others to ask themselves, the meaning of
every word which they use, of every word which they read; in
assuring them, whether they will believe us or not, that the
moral, as well as the intellectual culture, acquired by
translating accurately one dialogue of Plato, by making out
thoroughly the sense of one chapter of a standard author, is
greater than they will get from skimming whole folios of
Schlegelian &aelig;sthetics, resumes, histories of philosophy,
and the like second-hand information, or attending seven lectures
a-week till their lives&rsquo; end.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>It is better
to know one thing</i>, <i>than to know about ten thousand
things</i>.&nbsp; I cannot help feeling painfully, after reading
those most interesting Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli, that
the especial danger of this time is intellectual sciolism,
vagueness, sentimental eclecticism&mdash;and feeling, too, as
Socrates of old believed, that intellectual vagueness and
shallowness, however glib, and grand, and eloquent it may seem,
is inevitably the parent of a moral vagueness and shallowness,
which may leave our age as it left the later Greeks, without an
absolute standard of right or of truth, till it tries to escape
from its own scepticism, as the later Neoplatonists did, by
plunging desperately into any fetish-worshipping superstition
which holds out to its wearied and yet impatient intellect, the
bait of decisions already made for it, of objects of admiration
already formed and systematised.</p>
<p>Therefore let us honour the grammarian in his place; and,
among others, these old grammarians of Alexandria; only being
sure that as soon as any man begins, as they did, displaying
himself peacock-fashion, boasting of his science as the great
pursuit of humanity, and insulting his fellow-craftsmen, he
becomes, ipso facto, unable to discover any more truth for us,
having put on a habit of mind to which induction is impossible;
and is thenceforth to be passed by with a kindly but a pitying
smile.&nbsp; And so, indeed, it happened with these quarrelsome
Alexandrian grammarians, as it did with the Casaubons and
Scaligers and Daciers of the last two centuries.&nbsp; As soon as
they began quarrelling they lost the power of discovering.&nbsp;
The want of the inductive faculty in their attempts at philology
is utterly ludicrous.&nbsp; Most of their derivations of words
are about on a par with Jacob B&ouml;hmen&rsquo;s etymology of
sulphur, wherein he makes <i>sul</i>, if I recollect right,
signify some active principle of combustion, and <i>phur</i> the
passive one.&nbsp; It was left for more patient and less noisy
men, like Grimm, Bopp, and Buttmann, to found a science of
philology, to discover for us those great laws which connect
modern philology with history, ethnology, physiology, and with
the very deepest questions of theology itself.&nbsp; And in the
meanwhile, these Alexandrians&rsquo; worthless criticism has been
utterly swept away; while their real work, their accurate
editions of the classics, remain to us as a precious
heritage.&nbsp; So it is throughout history: nothing dies which
is worthy to live.&nbsp; The wheat is surely gathered into the
garner, the chaff is burnt up by that eternal fire which, happily
for this universe, cannot be quenched by any art of man, but goes
on forever, devouring without indulgence all the folly and the
falsehood of the world.</p>
<p>As yet you have heard nothing of the metaphysical schools of
Alexandria; for as yet none have existed, in the modern
acceptation of that word.&nbsp; Indeed, I am not sure that I must
not tell you frankly, that none ever existed at all in
Alexandria, in that same modern acceptation.&nbsp; Ritter, I
think, it is who complains na&iuml;vely enough, that the
Alexandrian Neoplatonists had a bad habit, which grew on them
more and more as the years rolled on, of mixing up philosophy
with theology, and so defiling, or at all events colouring, its
pure transparency.&nbsp; There is no denying the imputation, as I
shall show at greater length in my next Lecture.&nbsp; But one
would have thought, looking back through history, that the
Alexandrians were not the only philosophers guilty of this
shameful act of syncretism.&nbsp; Plato, one would have thought,
was as great a sinner as they.&nbsp; So were the Hindoos.&nbsp;
In spite of all their logical and metaphysical acuteness, they
were, you will find, unable to get rid of the notion that
theological inquiries concerning Brahma, Atma, Creeshna, were
indissolubly mixed up with that same logic and metaphysic.&nbsp;
The Parsees could not separate questions about Ahriman and Ormuzd
from Kant&rsquo;s three great philosophic problems: What is
Man?&mdash;What may be known?&mdash;What should be done?&nbsp;
Neither, indeed, could the earlier Greek sages.&nbsp; Not one of
them, of any school whatsoever&mdash;from the semi-mythic Seven
Sages to Plato and Aristotle&mdash;but finds it necessary to
consider not in passing, but as the great object of research,
questions concerning the gods:&mdash;whether they are real or
not; one or many; personal or impersonal; cosmic, and parts of
the universe, or organisers and rulers of it; in relation to man,
or without relation to him.&nbsp; Even in those who flatly deny
the existence of the gods, even in Lucretius himself, these
questions have to be considered, before the question, What is
man? can get any solution at all.&nbsp; On the answer given to
them is found to depend intimately the answer to the question,
What is the immaterial part of man?&nbsp; Is it a part of nature,
or of something above nature?&nbsp; Has he an immaterial part at
all?&mdash;in one word, Is a human metaphysic possible at
all?&nbsp; So it was with the Greek philosophers of old, even, as
Asclepius and Ammonius say, with Aristotle himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The object of Aristotle&rsquo;s metaphysic,&rdquo; one of
them says, &ldquo;is theological.&nbsp; Herein Aristotle
theologises.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there is no denying the
assertion.&nbsp; We must not then be hard on the Neoplatonists,
as if they were the first to mix things separate from the
foundation of the world.&nbsp; I do not say that theology and
metaphysic are separate studies.&nbsp; That is to be ascertained
only by seeing some one separate them.&nbsp; And when I see them
separated, I shall believe them separable.&nbsp; Only the
separation must not be produced by the simple expedient of
denying the existence of either one of them, or at least of
ignoring the existence of one steadily during the study of the
other.&nbsp; If they can be parted without injury to each other,
let them be parted; and till then let us suspend hard judgments
on the Alexandrian school of metaphysic, and also on the schools
of that curious people the Jews, who had at this period a
steadily increasing influence on the thought, as well as on the
commercial prosperity, of Alexandria.</p>
<p>You must not suppose, in the meanwhile, that the philosophers
whom the Ptolemies collected (as they would have any other
marketable article) by liberal offers of pay and patronage, were
such men as the old Seven Sages of Greece, or as Socrates, Plato,
and Aristotle.&nbsp; In these three last indeed, Greek thought
reached not merely its greatest height, but the edge of a
precipice, down which it rolled headlong after their
decease.&nbsp; The intellectual defects of the Greek mind, of
which I have already spoken, were doubtless one great cause of
this decay: but, to my mind, moral causes had still more to do
with it.&nbsp; The more cultivated Greek states, to judge from
the writings of Plato, had not been an over-righteous people
during the generation in which he lived.&nbsp; And in the
generations which followed, they became an altogether wicked
people; immoral, unbelieving, hating good, and delighting in all
which was evil.&nbsp; And it was in consequence of these very
sins of theirs, as I think, that the old Hellenic race began to
die out physically, and population throughout Greece to decrease
with frightful rapidity, after the time of the Ach&aelig;an
league.&nbsp; The facts are well known; and foul enough they
are.&nbsp; When the Romans destroyed Greece, God was just and
merciful.&nbsp; The eagles were gathered together only because
the carrion needed to be removed from the face of God&rsquo;s
earth.&nbsp; And at the time of which I now speak, the signs of
approaching death were fearfully apparent.&nbsp; Hapless and
hopeless enough were the clique of men out of whom the first two
Ptolemies hoped to form a school of philosophy; men certainly
clever enough, and amusing withal, who might give the kings of
Egypt many a shrewd lesson in king-craft, and the ways of this
world, and the art of profiting by the folly of fools, and the
selfishness of the selfish; or who might amuse them, in default
of fighting-cocks, by puns and repartees, and battles of logic;
&ldquo;how one thing cannot be predicated of another,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;how the wise man is not only to overcome every misfortune,
but not even to feel it,&rdquo; and other such mighty questions,
which in those days hid that deep unbelief in any truth
whatsoever which was spreading fast over the minds of men.&nbsp;
Such word-splitters were Stilpo and Diodorus, the slayer and the
slain.&nbsp; They were of the Megaran school, and were named
Dialectics; and also, with more truth, Eristics, or
quarrellers.&nbsp; Their clique had professed to follow Zeno and
Socrates in declaring the instability of sensible presumptions
and conclusions, in preaching an absolute and eternal
Being.&nbsp; But there was this deep gulf between them and
Socrates; that while Socrates professed to be seeking for the
Absolute and Eternal, for that which is, they were content with
affirming that it exists.&nbsp; With him, as with the older
sages, philosophy was a search for truth.&nbsp; With them it was
a scheme of doctrines to be defended.&nbsp; And the dialectic on
which they prided themselves so much, differed from his
accordingly.&nbsp; He used it inductively, to seek out, under the
notions and conceptions of the mind, certain absolute truths and
laws of which they were only the embodiment.&nbsp; Words and
thought were to him a field for careful and reverent induction,
as the phenomena of nature are to us the disciples of
Bacon.&nbsp; But with these hapless Megarans, who thought that
they had found that for which Socrates professed only to seek
dimly and afar off, and had got it safe in a dogma, preserved as
it were in spirits, and put by in a museum, the great use of
dialectic was to confute opponents.&nbsp; Delight in their own
subtlety grew on them, the worship not of objective truth, but of
the forms of the intellect whereby it may be demonstrated; till
they became the veriest word-splitters, rivals of the old
sophists whom their master had attacked, and justified too often
Aristophanes&rsquo; calumny, which confounded Socrates with his
opponents, as a man whose aim was to make the worse appear the
better reason.</p>
<p>We have here, in both parties, all the marks of an age of
exhaustion, of scepticism, of despair about finding any real
truth.&nbsp; No wonder that they were superseded by the
Pyrrhonists, who doubted all things, and by the Academy, which
prided itself on setting up each thing to knock it down again;
and so by prudent and well-bred and tolerant qualifying of every
assertion, neither affirming too much, nor denying too much, keep
their minds in a wholesome&mdash;or unwholesome&mdash;state of
equilibrium, as stagnant pools are kept, that everything may have
free toleration to rot undisturbed.</p>
<p>These hapless caricaturists of the dialectic of Plato, and the
logic of Aristotle, careless of any vital principles or real
results, ready enough to use fallacies each for their own party,
and openly proud of their success in doing so, were assisted by
worthy compeers of an outwardly opposite tone of thought, the
Cyrenaics, Theodorus and Hegesias.&nbsp; With their clique, as
with their master Aristippus, the senses were the only avenues to
knowledge; man was the measure of all things; and
&ldquo;happiness our being&rsquo;s end and aim.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Theodorus was surnamed the Atheist; and, it seems, not without
good reason; for he taught that there was no absolute or eternal
difference between good and evil; nothing really disgraceful in
crimes; no divine ground for laws, which according to him had
been invented by men to prevent fools from making themselves
disagreeable; on which theory, laws must be confessed to have
been in all ages somewhat of a failure.&nbsp; He seems to have
been, like his master, an impudent light-hearted fellow, who took
life easily enough, laughed at patriotism, and all other
high-flown notions, boasted that the world was his country, and
was no doubt excellent after-dinner company for the great
king.&nbsp; Hegesias, his fellow Cyrenaic, was a man of a darker
and more melancholic temperament; and while Theodorus contented
himself with preaching a comfortable selfishness, and obtaining
pleasure, made it rather his study to avoid pain.&nbsp; Doubtless
both their theories were popular enough at Alexandria, as they
were in France during the analogous period, the Si&egrave;cle
Louis Quinze.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Contrat Social,&rdquo; and the
rest of their doctrines, moral and metaphysical, will always have
their admirers on earth, as long as that variety of the human
species exists for whose especial behoof Theodorus held that laws
were made; and the whole form of thought met with great
approbation in after years at Rome, where Epicurus carried it to
its highest perfection.&nbsp; After that, under the pressure of a
train of rather severe lessons, which Gibbon has detailed in his
&ldquo;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,&rdquo; little or
nothing was heard of it, save <i>sotto voce</i>, perhaps, at the
Papal courts of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; To revive it
publicly, or at least as much of it as could be borne by a world
now for seventeen centuries Christian, was the glory of the
eighteenth century.&nbsp; The moral scheme of Theodorus has now
nearly vanished among us, at least as a confessed creed; and, in
spite of the authority of Mr. Locke&rsquo;s great and good name,
his metaphysical scheme is showing signs of a like approaching
disappearance.&nbsp; Let us hope that it may be a speedy one; for
if the senses be the only avenues to knowledge; if man be the
measure of all things; and if law have not, as Hooker says, her
fount and home in the very bosom of God himself, then was
Homer&rsquo;s Zeus right in declaring man to be &ldquo;the most
wretched of all the beasts of the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet one cannot help looking with a sort of awe (I dare not
call it respect) at that melancholic faithless Hegesias.&nbsp;
Doubtless he, like his compeers, and indeed all Alexandria for
three hundred years, cultivated philosophy with no more real
purpose than it was cultivated by the graceless
<i>beaux-esprits</i> of Louis XV.&rsquo;s court, and with as
little practical effect on morality; but of this Hegesias alone
it stands written, that his teaching actually made men do
something; and moreover, do the most solemn and important thing
which any man can do, excepting always doing right.&nbsp; I must
confess, however, that the result of his teaching took so
unexpected a form, that the reigning Ptolemy, apparently
Philadelphus, had to interfere with the sacred right of every man
to talk as much nonsense as he likes, and forbade Hegesias to
teach at Alexandria.&nbsp; For Hegesias, a Cyrenaic like
Theodorus, but a rather more morose pedant than that saucy and
happy scoffer, having discovered that the great end of man was to
avoid pain, also discovered (his digestion being probably in a
disordered state) that there was so much more pain than pleasure
in the world, as to make it a thoroughly disagreeable place, of
which man was well rid at any price.&nbsp; Whereon he wrote a
book called,
&#7944;&pi;&omicron;&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&#8182;&nu;,
in which a man who had determined to starve himself, preached the
miseries of human life, and the blessings of death, with such
overpowering force, that the book actually drove many persons to
commit suicide, and escape from a world which was not fit to
dwell in.&nbsp; A fearful proof of how rotten the state of
society was becoming, how desperate the minds of men, during
those frightful centuries which immediately preceded the
Christian era, and how fast was approaching that dark chaos of
unbelief and unrighteousness, which Paul of Tarsus so analyses
and describes in the first chapter of his Epistle to the
Romans&mdash;when the old light was lost, the old faiths extinct,
the old reverence for the laws of family and national life,
destroyed, yea even the natural instincts themselves perverted;
that chaos whose darkness Juvenal, and Petronius, and Tacitus
have proved, in their fearful pages, not to have been exaggerated
by the more compassionate though more righteous Jew.</p>
<p>And now observe, that this selfishness&mdash;this wholesome
state of equilibrium&mdash;this philosophic calm, which is really
only a lazy pride, was, as far as we can tell, the main object of
all the schools from the time of Alexander to the Christian
era.&nbsp; We know very little of those Sceptics, Cynics,
Epicureans, Academics, Peripatetics, Stoics, of whom there has
been so much talk, except at second-hand, through the Romans,
from whom Stoicism in after ages received a new and not ignoble
life.&nbsp; But this we do know of the later sets, that they
gradually gave up the search for truth, and propounded to
themselves as the great type for a philosopher, How shall a man
save his own soul from this evil world? They may have been right;
it may have been the best thing to think about in those exhausted
and decaying times: but it was a question of ethics, not of
philosophy, in the sense which the old Greek sages put on that
latter word.&nbsp; Their object was, not to get at the laws of
all things, but to fortify themselves against all things, each
according to his scheme, and so to be self-sufficient and
alone.&nbsp; Even in the Stoics, who boldly and righteously
asserted an immutable morality, this was the leading
conception.&nbsp; As has been well said of them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we reflect how deeply the feeling of an intercourse
between men and a divine race superior to themselves had worked
itself into the Greek character&mdash;what a number of fables,
some beautiful, some impure, it had impregnated and procured
credence for&mdash;how it sustained every form of polity and
every system of laws, we may imagine what the effects must have
been of its disappearance.&nbsp; If it is possible for any man,
it was not, certainly, possible for a Greek, to feel himself
connected by any real bonds with his fellow-creatures around him,
while he felt himself utterly separated from any being above his
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; But the sense of that isolation would
affect different minds very differently.&nbsp; It drove the
Epicurean to consider how he might make a world in which he
should live comfortably, without distracting visions of the past
and future, and the dread of those upper powers who no longer
awakened in him any feelings of sympathy.&nbsp; It drove Zeno the
Stoic to consider whether a man may not find enough in himself to
satisfy him, though what is beyond him be ever so unfriendly. . .
. We may trace in the productions which are attributed to Zone a
very clear indication of the feeling which was at work in his
mind.&nbsp; He undertook, for instance, among other tasks, to
answer Plato&rsquo;s &lsquo;Republic.&rsquo;&nbsp; The truth that
a man is a political being, which informs and pervades that book,
was one which must have been particularly harassing to his mind,
and which he felt must be got rid of, before he could hope to
assert his doctrine of a man&rsquo;s solitary dignity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woe to the nation or the society in which this individualising
and separating process is going on in the human mind!&nbsp;
Whether it take the form of a religion or of a philosophy, it is
at once the sign and the cause of senility, decay, and
death.&nbsp; If man begins to forget that he is a social being, a
member of a body, and that the only truths which can avail him
anything, the only truths which are worthy objects of his
philosophical search, are those which are equally true for every
man, which will equally avail every man, which he must proclaim,
as far as he can, to every man, from the proudest sage to the
meanest outcast, he enters, I believe, into a lie, and helps
forward the dissolution of that society of which he is a
member.&nbsp; I care little whether what he holds be true or
not.&nbsp; If it be true, he has made it a lie by appropriating
it proudly and selfishly to himself, and by excluding others from
it.&nbsp; He has darkened his own power of vision by that act of
self-appropriation, so that even if he sees a truth, he can only
see it refractedly, discoloured by the medium of his own private
likes and dislikes, and fulfils that great and truly philosophic
law, that he who loveth not his brother is in darkness, and
knoweth not whither he goeth.&nbsp; And so it befell those old
Greek schools.&nbsp; It is out of our path to follow them to
Italy, where sturdy old Roman patriots cursed them, and with good
reason, as corrupting the morals of the young.&nbsp; Our business
is with Alexandria; and there, certainly, they did nothing for
the elevation of humanity.&nbsp; What culture they may have
given, probably helped to make the Alexandrians, what C&aelig;sar
calls them, the most ingenious of all nations: but righteous or
valiant men it did not make them.&nbsp; When, after the three
great reigns of Soter, Philadelphus, and Euergetes, the race of
the Ptolemies began to wear itself out, Alexandria fell morally,
as its sovereigns fell; and during a miserable and shameful
decline of a hundred and eighty years, sophists wrangled, pedants
fought over accents and readings with the true <i>odium
gammaticum</i>, and kings plunged deeper and deeper into the
abysses of luxury and incest, laziness and cruelty, till the
flood came, and swept them all away.&nbsp; Cleopatra, the Helen
of Egypt, betrayed her country to the Roman; and thenceforth the
Alexandrians became slaves in all but name.</p>
<p>And now that Alexandria has become a tributary province, is it
to share the usual lot of enslaved countries and lose all
originality and vigour of thought?&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; From this
point, strangely enough, it begins to have a philosophy of its
own.&nbsp; Hitherto it has been importing Greek thought into
Egypt and Syria, even to the furthest boundaries of Persia; and
the whole East has become Greek: but it has received little in
return.&nbsp; The Indian Gymnosophists, or Brahmins, had little
or no effect on Greek philosophy, except in the case of Pyrrho:
the Persian Dualism still less.&nbsp; The Egyptian symbolic
nature-worship had been too gross to be regarded by the
cultivated Alexandrian as anything but a barbaric
superstition.&nbsp; One eastern nation had intermingled closely
with the Macedonian race, and from it Alexandrian thought
received a new impulse.</p>
<p>I mentioned in my first lecture the conciliatory policy which
the Ptolemies had pursued toward the Jews.&nbsp; Soter had not
only allowed but encouraged them to settle in Alexandria and
Egypt, granting them the same political privileges with the
Macedonians and other Greeks.&nbsp; Soon they built themselves a
temple there, in obedience to some supposed prophecy in their
sacred writings, which seems most probably to have been a wilful
interpolation.&nbsp; Whatsoever value we may attach to the
various myths concerning the translation of their Scriptures into
Greek, there can be no doubt that they were translated in the
reign of Soter, and that the exceedingly valuable Septuagint
version is the work of that period.&nbsp; Moreover, their numbers
in Alexandria were very great.&nbsp; When Amrou took
Constantinople in <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 640, there
were 40,000 Jews in it; and their numbers during the Ptolemaic
and Roman periods, before their temporary expulsion by Cyril
about 412, were probably greater; and Egypt altogether is said to
have contained 200,000 Jews.&nbsp; They had schools there, which
were so esteemed by their whole nation throughout the East, that
the Alexandrian Rabbis, the Light of Israel, as they were called,
may be fairly considered as the centre of Jewish thought and
learning for several centuries.</p>
<p>We are accustomed, and not without reason, to think with some
contempt of these old Rabbis.&nbsp; Rabbinism, Cabbalism, are
become by-words in the mouths of men.&nbsp; It may be instructive
for us&mdash;it is certainly necessary for us, if we wish to
understand Alexandria&mdash;to examine a little how they became
so fallen.</p>
<p>Their philosophy took its stand, as you all know, on certain
ancient books of their people; histories, laws, poems,
philosophical treatises, which all have one element peculiar to
themselves, namely, the assertion of a living personal Ruler and
Teacher, not merely of the Jewish race, but of all the nations of
the earth.&nbsp; After the return of their race from Babylon,
their own records give abundant evidence that this strange people
became the most exclusive and sectarian which the world ever
saw.&nbsp; Into the causes of that exclusiveness I will not now
enter; suffice it to say, that it was pardonable enough in a
people asserting Monotheism in the midst of idolatrous nations,
and who knew, from experience even more bitter than that which
taught Plato and Socrates, how directly all those popular
idolatries led to every form of baseness and immorality.&nbsp;
But we may trace in them, from the date of their return from
Babylon, especially from their settlement in Alexandria, a
singular change of opinion.&nbsp; In proportion as they began to
deny that their unseen personal Ruler had anything to do with the
Gentiles&mdash;the nations of the earth, as they called
them&mdash;in proportion as they considered themselves as His
only subjects&mdash;or rather, Him and His guidance as their own
private property&mdash;exactly in that proportion they began to
lose all living or practical belief that He did guide them.&nbsp;
He became a being of the past; one who had taught and governed
their forefathers in old times: not one who was teaching and
governing them now.&nbsp; I beg you to pay attention to this
curious result; because you will see, I think, the very same
thing occurring in two other Alexandrian schools, of which I
shall speak hereafter.</p>
<p>The result to these Rabbis was, that the inspired books which
spoke of this Divine guidance and government became objects of
superstitious reverence, just in proportion as they lost all
understanding of their real value and meaning.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, this too produced good results; for the greatest
possible care was taken to fix the Canon of these books; to
settle, as far as possible, the exact time at which the Divine
guidance was supposed to have ceased; after which it was impious
to claim a Divine teaching; when their sages were left to
themselves, as they fancied, with a complete body of knowledge,
on which they were henceforth only to comment.&nbsp; Thus,
whether or not they were right in supposing that the Divine
Teacher had ceased to teach and inspire them, they did infinite
service by marking out for us certain writers whom He had
certainly taught and inspired.&nbsp; No doubt they were right in
their sense of the awful change which had passed over their
nation.&nbsp; There was an infinite difference between them and
the old Hebrew writers.&nbsp; They had lost something which those
old prophets possessed.&nbsp; I invite you to ponder, each for
himself, on the causes of this strange loss; bearing in mind that
they lost their forefathers&rsquo; heirloom, exactly in
proportion as they began to believe it to be their exclusive
possession, and to deny other human beings any right to or share
in it.&nbsp; It may have been that the light given to their
forefathers had, as they thought, really departed.&nbsp; It may
have been, also, that the light was there all around them still,
as bright as ever, but that they would not open their eyes and
behold it; or rather, could not open them, because selfishness
and pride had sealed them.&nbsp; It may have been, that
inspiration was still very near <i>them</i> too, if their spirits
had been willing to receive it.&nbsp; But of the fact of the
change there was no doubt.&nbsp; For the old Hebrew seers were
men dealing with the loftiest and deepest laws: the Rabbis were
shallow pedants.&nbsp; The old Hebrew seers were righteous and
virtuous men: the Rabbis became, in due time, some of the worst
and wickedest men who ever trod this earth.</p>
<p>Thus they too had their share in that downward career of
pedantry which we have seen characterise the whole past
Alexandrine age.&nbsp; They, like Zenodotus and Aristarchus, were
commentators, grammarians, sectarian disputers: they were not
thinkers or actors.&nbsp; Their inspired books were to them no
more the words of living human beings who had sought for the
Absolute Wisdom, and found it after many sins and doubts and
sorrows.&nbsp; The human writers became in their eyes the puppets
and mouthpieces of some magical influence, not the disciples of a
living and loving person.&nbsp; The book itself was, in their
belief, not in any true sense inspired, but magically
dictated&mdash;by what power they cared not to define.&nbsp; His
character was unimportant to them, provided He had inspired no
nation but their own.&nbsp; But, thought they, if the words were
dictated, each of them must have some mysterious value.&nbsp; And
if each word had a mysterious value, why not each letter?&nbsp;
And how could they set limits to that mysterious value?&nbsp;
Might not these words, even rearrangements of the letters of
them, be useful in protecting them against the sorceries of the
heathen, in driving away those evil spirits, or evoking those
good spirits, who, though seldom mentioned in their early
records, had after their return from Babylon begun to form an
important part of their unseen world?&nbsp; For as they had lost
faith in the One Preserver of their race, they had filled up the
void by a ponderous demonology of innumerable preservers.&nbsp;
This process of thought was not confined to Alexandria.&nbsp; Dr.
Layard, in his last book on Nineveh, gives some curious instances
of its prevalence among them at an earlier period, well worth
your careful study.&nbsp; But it was at Alexandria that the
Jewish Cabbalism formed itself into a system.&nbsp; It was there
that the Jews learnt to become the jugglers and magic-mongers of
the whole Roman world, till Claudius had to expel them from Rome,
as pests to rational and moral society.</p>
<p>And yet, among these hapless pedants there lingered nobler
thoughts and hopes.&nbsp; They could not read the glorious
heirlooms of their race without finding in them records of
antique greatness and virtue, of old deliverances worked for
their forefathers; and what seemed promises, too, that that
greatness should return.&nbsp; The notion that those promises
were conditional; that they expressed eternal moral laws, and
declared the consequences of obeying those laws, they had lost
long ago.&nbsp; By looking on themselves as exclusively and
arbitrarily favoured by Heaven, they were ruining their own moral
sense.&nbsp; Things were not right or wrong to them because Right
was eternal and divine, and Wrong the transgression of that
eternal right.&nbsp; How could that be?&nbsp; For then the right
things the Gentiles seemed to do would be right and
divine;&mdash;and that supposition in their eyes was all but
impious.&nbsp; None could do right but themselves, for they only
knew the law of God.&nbsp; So, right with them had no absolute or
universal ground, but was reduced in their minds to the
performance of certain acts commanded exclusively to them&mdash;a
form of ethics which rapidly sank into the most petty and
frivolous casuistry as to the outward performance of those
acts.&nbsp; The sequel of those ethics is known to all the world,
in the spectacle of the most unrivalled religiosity, and
scrupulous respectability, combined with a more utter absence of
moral sense, in their most cultivated and learned men, than the
world has ever beheld before or since.</p>
<p>In such a state of mind it was impossible for them to look on
their old prophets as true seers, beholding and applying eternal
moral laws, and, therefore, seeing the future in the present and
in the past.&nbsp; They must be the mere utterers of an
irreversible arbitrary fate; and that fate must, of course, be
favourable to their nation.&nbsp; So now arose a school who
picked out from their old prophets every passage which could be
made to predict their future glory, and a science which settled
when that glory was to return.&nbsp; By the arbitrary rules of
criticism a prophetic day was defined to mean a year; a week,
seven years.&nbsp; The most simple and human utterances were
found to have recondite meanings relative to their future triumph
over the heathens whom they cursed and hated.&nbsp; If any of you
ever come across the popular Jewish interpretations of The Song
of Solomon, you will there see the folly in which acute and
learned men can indulge themselves when they have lost hold of
the belief in anything really absolute and eternal and moral, and
have made Fate, and Time, and Self, their real deities.&nbsp; But
this dream of a future restoration was in no wise ennobled, as
far as we can see, with any desire for a moral restoration.&nbsp;
They believed that a person would appear some day or other to
deliver them.&nbsp; Even they were happily preserved by their
sacred books from the notion that deliverance was to be found for
them, or for any man, in an abstraction or notion ending in
-ation or -ality.&nbsp; In justice to them it must be said, that
they were too wise to believe that personal qualities, such as
power, will, love, righteousness, could reside in any but in a
person, or be manifested except by a person.&nbsp; And among the
earlier of them the belief may have been, that the ancient unseen
Teacher of their race would be their deliverer: but as they lost
the thought of Him, the expected Deliverer became a mere human
being: or rather not a human being; for as they lost their moral
sense, they lost in the very deepest meaning their humanity, and
forgot what man was like till they learned to look only for a
conqueror; a manifestation of power, and not of goodness; a
destroyer of the hated heathen, who was to establish them as the
tyrant race of the whole earth.&nbsp; On that fearful day on
which, for a moment, they cast away even that last dream, and
cried, &ldquo;We have no king but C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; they spoke
the secret of their hearts.&nbsp; It was a C&aelig;sar, a Jewish
C&aelig;sar, for whom they had been longing for centuries.&nbsp;
And if they could not have such a deliverer, they would have
none: they would take up with the best embodiment of brute
Titanic power which they could find, and crucify the embodiment
of Righteousness and Love.&nbsp; Amid all the metaphysical
schools of Alexandria, I know none so deeply instructive as that
school of the Rabbis, &ldquo;the glory of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But you will say: &ldquo;This does not look like a school
likely to regenerate Alexandrian thought.&rdquo;&nbsp; True: and
yet it did regenerate it, both for good and for evil; for these
men had among them and preserved faithfully enough for all
practical purposes, the old literature of their race; a
literature which I firmly believe, if I am to trust the
experience of 1900 years, is destined to explain all other
literatures; because it has firm hold of the one eternal
root-idea which gives life, meaning, Divine sanction, to every
germ or fragment of human truth which is in any of them.&nbsp; It
did so, at least, in Alexandria for the Greek literature.&nbsp;
About the Christian era, a cultivated Alexandrian Jew, a disciple
of Plato and of Aristotle, did seem to himself to find in the
sacred books of his nation that which agreed with the deepest
discoveries of Greek philosophy; which explained and corroborated
them.&nbsp; And his announcement of this fact, weak and defective
as it was, had the most enormous and unexpected results.&nbsp;
The father of New Platonism was Philo the Jew.</p>
<h2>LECTURE III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NEOPLATONISM.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now approach the period in which
Alexandria began to have a philosophy of its own&mdash;to be,
indeed, the leader of human thought for several centuries.</p>
<p>I shall enter on this branch of my subject with some fear and
trembling; not only on account of my own ignorance, but on
account of the great difficulty of handling it without trenching
on certain controversial subjects which are rightly and wisely
forbidden here.&nbsp; For there was not one school of Metaphysic
at Alexandria: there were two; which, during the whole period of
their existence, were in internecine struggle with each other,
and yet mutually borrowing from each other; the Heathen, namely,
and the Christian.&nbsp; And you cannot contemplate, still less
can you understand, the one without the other.&nbsp; Some of late
years have become all but unaware of the existence of that
Christian school; and the word Philosophy, on the authority of
Gibbon, who, however excellent an authority for facts, knew
nothing about Philosophy, and cared less, has been used
exclusively to express heathen thought; a misnomer which in
Alexandria would have astonished Plotinus or Hypatia as much as
it would Clement or Origen.&nbsp; I do not say that there is, or
ought to be, a Christian Metaphysic.&nbsp; I am speaking, as you
know, merely as a historian, dealing with facts; and I say that
there was one; as profound, as scientific, as severe, as that of
the Pagan Neoplatonists; starting indeed, as I shall show
hereafter, on many points from common ground with theirs.&nbsp;
One can hardly doubt, I should fancy, that many parts of St.
John&rsquo;s Gospel and Epistles, whatever view we may take of
them, if they are to be called anything, are to be called
metaphysic and philosophic.&nbsp; And one can no more doubt that
before writing them he had studied Philo, and was expanding
Philo&rsquo;s thought in the direction which seemed fit to him,
than we can doubt it of the earlier Neoplatonists.&nbsp; The
technical language is often identical; so are the primary ideas
from which he starts, howsoever widely the conclusions may
differ.&nbsp; If Plotinus considered himself an intellectual
disciple of Plato, so did Origen and Clemens.&nbsp; And I must,
as I said before, speak of both, or of neither.&nbsp; My only
hope of escaping delicate ground lies in the curious fact, that
rightly or wrongly, the form in which Christianity presented
itself to the old Alexandrian thinkers was so utterly different
from the popular conception of it in modern England, that one may
very likely be able to tell what little one knows about it,
almost without mentioning a single doctrine which now influences
the religious world.</p>
<p>But far greater is my fear, that to a modern British auditory,
trained in the school of Locke, much of ancient thought, heathen
as well as Christian, may seem so utterly the product of the
imagination, so utterly without any corresponding reality in the
universe, as to look like mere unintelligible madness.&nbsp;
Still, I must try; only entreating my hearers to consider, that
how much soever we may honour Locke and his great Scotch
followers, we are not bound to believe them either infallible, or
altogether world-embracing; that there have been other methods
than theirs of conceiving the Unseen; that the common ground from
which both Christian and heathen Alexandrians start, is not
merely a private vagary of their own, but one which has been
accepted undoubtingly, under so many various forms, by so many
different races, as to give something of an inductive probability
that it is not a mere dream, but may be a right and true instinct
of the human mind.&nbsp; I mean the belief that the things which
we see&mdash;nature and all her phenomena&mdash;are temporal, and
born only to die; mere shadows of some unseen realities, from
whom their laws and life are derived; while the eternal things
which subsist without growth, decay, or change, the only real,
only truly existing things, in short, are certain things which
are not seen; inappreciable by sense, or understanding, or
imagination, perceived only by the conscience and the
reason.&nbsp; And that, again, the problem of philosophy, the
highest good for man, that for the sake of which death were a
gain, without which life is worthless, a drudgery, a degradation,
a failure, and a ruin, is to discover what those unseen eternal
things are, to know them, possess them, be in harmony with them,
and thereby alone to rise to any real and solid power, or safety,
or nobleness.&nbsp; It is a strange dream.&nbsp; But you will see
that it is one which does not bear much upon &ldquo;points of
controversy,&rdquo; any more than on &ldquo;Locke&rsquo;s
philosophy;&rdquo; nevertheless, when we find this same strange
dream arising, apparently without intercommunion of thought,
among the old Hindoos, among the Greeks, among the Jews; and
lastly, when we see it springing again in the Middle Age, in the
mind of the almost forgotten author of the &ldquo;Deutsche
Theologie,&rdquo; and so becoming the parent, not merely of
Luther&rsquo;s deepest belief, or of the German mystic schools of
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but of the great German
Philosophy itself as developed by Kant, and Fichte, and
Schelling, and Hegel, we must at least confess it to be a popular
delusion, if nothing better, vast enough and common enough to be
worth a little patient investigation, wheresoever we may find it
stirring the human mind.</p>
<p>But I have hope, still, that I may find sympathy and
comprehension among some, at least, of my audience, as I proceed
to examine the ancient realist schools of Alexandria, on account
of their knowledge of the modern realist schools of
Germany.&nbsp; For I cannot but see, that a revulsion is taking
place in the thoughts of our nation upon metaphysic subjects, and
that Scotland, as usual, is taking the lead therein.&nbsp; That
most illustrious Scotchman, Mr. Thomas Carlyle, first vindicated
the great German Realists from the vulgar misconceptions about
them which were so common at the beginning of this century, and
brought the minds of studious men to a more just appreciation of
the philosophic severity, the moral grandeur, of such thinkers as
Emmanuel Kant, and Gottlieb Fichte.&nbsp; To another Scotch
gentleman, who, I believe, has honoured me by his presence here
to-night, we owe most valuable translations of some of
Fichte&rsquo;s works; to be followed, I trust, by more.&nbsp; And
though, as a humble disciple of Bacon, I cannot but think that
the method both of Kant and Fichte possesses somewhat of the same
inherent defect as the method of the Neoplatonist school, yet I
should be most unfair did I not express my deep obligations to
them, and advise all those to study them carefully, who wish to
gain a clear conception either of the old Alexandrian schools, or
of those intellectual movements which are agitating the modern
mind, and which will, I doubt not, issue in a clearer light, and
in a nobler life, if not for us, yet still for our
children&rsquo;s children for ever.</p>
<p>The name of Philo the Jew is now all but forgotten among
us.&nbsp; He was laughed out of sight during the last century, as
a dreamer and an allegorist, who tried eclectically to patch
together Plato and Moses.&nbsp; The present age, however, is
rapidly beginning to suspect that all who thought before the
eighteenth century were not altogether either fools or impostors;
old wisdom is obtaining a fairer hearing day by day, and is found
not to be so contradictory to new wisdom as was supposed.&nbsp;
We are beginning, too, to be more inclined to justify Providence,
by believing that lies are by their very nature impotent and
doomed to die; that everything which has had any great or
permanent influence on the human mind, must have in it some germ
of eternal truth; and setting ourselves to separate that germ of
truth from the mistakes which may have distorted and overlaid
it.&nbsp; Let us believe, or at least hope, the same for a few
minutes, of Philo, and try to find out what was the secret of his
power, what the secret of his weakness.</p>
<p>First: I cannot think that he had to treat his own sacred
books unfairly, to make them agree with the root-idea of Socrates
and Plato.&nbsp; Socrates and Plato acknowledged a Divine teacher
of the human spirit; that was the ground of their
philosophy.&nbsp; So did the literature of the Jews.&nbsp;
Socrates and Plato, with all the Greek sages till the Sophistic
era, held that the object of philosophy was the search after that
which truly exists: that he who found that, found wisdom:
Philo&rsquo;s books taught him the same truth: but they taught
him also, that the search for wisdom was not merely the search
for that which is, but for Him who is; not for a thing, but for a
person.&nbsp; I do not mean that Plato and the elder Greeks had
not that object also in view; for I have said already that
Theology was with them the ultimate object of all metaphysic
science: but I do think that they saw it infinitely less clearly
than the old Jewish sages.&nbsp; Those sages were utterly unable
to conceive of an absolute truth, except as residing in an
absolutely true person; of absolute wisdom, except in an
absolutely wise person; of an absolute order and law, except in a
lawgiver; of an absolute good, except in an absolutely good
person: any more than either they or we can conceive of an
absolute love, except in an absolutely loving person.&nbsp; I say
boldly, that I think them right, on all grounds of Baconian
induction.&nbsp; For all these qualities are only known to us as
exhibited in persons; and if we believe them to have any absolute
and eternal existence at all, to be objective, and independent of
us, and the momentary moods and sentiments of our own mind, they
must exist in some absolute and eternal person, or they are mere
notions, abstractions, words, which have no counterparts.</p>
<p>But here arose a puzzle in the mind of Philo, as it in reality
had, we may see, in the minds of Socrates and Plato.&nbsp; How
could he reconcile the idea of that absolute and eternal one
Being, that Zeus, Father of Gods and men, self-perfect,
self-contained, without change or motion, in whom, as a Jew, he
believed even more firmly than the Platonists, with the
D&aelig;mon of Socrates, the Divine Teacher whom both Plato and
Solomon confessed?&nbsp; Or how, again, could he reconcile the
idea of Him with the creative and providential energy, working in
space and time, working on matter, and apparently affected and
limited, if not baffled, by the imperfection of the minds which
he taught, by the imperfection of the matter which he
moulded?&nbsp; This, as all students of philosophy must know, was
one of the great puzzles of old Greek philosophy, as long as it
was earnest and cared to have any puzzles at all: it has been,
since the days of Spinoza, the great puzzle of all earnest modern
philosophers.&nbsp; Philo offered a solution in that idea of a
Logos, or Word of God, Divinity articulate, speaking and acting
in time and space, and therefore by successive acts; and so
doing, in time and space, the will of the timeless and spaceless
Father, the Abysmal and Eternal Being, of whom he was the perfect
likeness.&nbsp; In calling this person the Logos, and making him
the source of all human reason, and knowledge of eternal laws, he
only translated from Hebrew into Greek the name which he found in
his sacred books, &ldquo;The Word of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; As yet we
have found no unfair allegorising of Moses, or twisting of
Plato.&nbsp; How then has he incurred this accusation?</p>
<p>I cannot think, again, that he was unfair in supposing that he
might hold at the same time the Jewish belief concerning
Creation, and the Platonic doctrine of the real existence of
Archetypal ideas, both of moral and of physical phenomena.&nbsp;
I do not mean that such a conception was present consciously to
the mind of the old Jews, as it was most certainly to the mind of
St. Paul, a practised Platonic dialectician; but it seems to me,
as to Philo, to be a fair, perhaps a necessary, corollary from
the Genetic Philosophy, both of Moses and of Solomon.</p>
<p>But in one thing he was unfair; namely, in his
allegorising.&nbsp; But unfair to whom?&nbsp; To Socrates and
Plato, I believe, as much as to Moses and to Samuel.&nbsp; For
what is the part of the old Jewish books which he evaporates away
into mere mystic symbols of the private experiences of the devout
philosopher?&nbsp; Its practical everyday histories, which deal
with the common human facts of family and national life, of
man&rsquo;s outward and physical labour and craft.&nbsp; These to
him have no meaning, except an allegoric one.&nbsp; But has he
thrown them away for the sake of getting a step nearer to
Socrates, or Plato, or Aristotle?&nbsp; Surely not.&nbsp; To
them, as to the old Jewish sages, man is most important when
regarded not merely as a soul, but as a man, a social being of
flesh and blood.&nbsp; Aristotle declares politics to be the
architectonical science, the family and social relations to be
the eternal master-facts of humanity.&nbsp; Plato, in his
Republic, sets before himself the Constitution of a State, as the
crowning problem of his philosophy.&nbsp; Every work of his, like
every saying of his master Socrates, deals with the common,
outward, vulgar facts of human life, and asserts that there is a
divine meaning in them, and that reverent induction from them is
the way to obtain the deepest truths.&nbsp; Socrates and Plato
were as little inclined to separate the man and the philosopher
as Moses, Solomon, or Isaiah were.&nbsp; When Philo, by
allegorising away the simple human parts of his books, is untrue
to Moses&rsquo;s teaching, he becomes untrue to
Plato&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He becomes untrue, I believe, to a higher
teaching than Plato&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He loses sight of an eternal
truth, which even old Homer might have taught him, when he treats
Moses as one section of his disciples in after years treated
Homer.</p>
<p>For what is the secret of the eternal freshness, the eternal
beauty, ay, I may say boldly, in spite of all their absurdities
and immoralities, the eternal righteousness of those old Greek
myths?&nbsp; What is it which made Socrates and Plato cling
lovingly and reverently to them, they scarce knew why, while they
deplored the immoralities to which they had given rise?&nbsp;
What is it which made those myths, alone of all old mythologies,
the parents of truly beautiful sculpture, painting, poetry? What
is it which makes us love them still; find, even at times against
our consciences, new meaning, new beauty in them; and brings home
the story of Perseas or of Hercules, alike to the practised
reason of Niebuhr, and the untutored instincts of Niebuhr&rsquo;s
little child, for whom he threw them into simplest forms?&nbsp;
Why is it that in spite of our disagreeing with their creed and
their morality, we still persist&mdash;and long may we persist,
or rather be compelled&mdash;as it were by blind instinct, to
train our boys upon those old Greek dreams; and confess, whenever
we try to find a substitute for them in our educational schemes,
that we have as yet none?&nbsp; Because those old Greek stories
do represent the Deities as the archetypes, the kinsmen, the
teachers, the friends, the inspirers of men.&nbsp; Because while
the schoolboy reads how the Gods were like to men, only better,
wiser, greater; how the Heroes are the children of the Gods, and
the slayers of the monsters which devour the earth; how Athene
taught men weaving, and Ph&oelig;bus music, and Vulcan the
cunning of the stithy; how the Gods took pity on the
noble-hearted son of Danae, and lent him celestial arms and
guided him over desert and ocean to fulfil his vow&mdash;that boy
is learning deep lessons of metaphysic, more in accordance with
the <i>reine vernunft</i>, the pure reason whereby man perceives
that which is moral, and spiritual, and eternal, than he would
from all disquisitions about being and becoming, about
actualities and potentialities, which ever tormented the weary
brain of man.</p>
<p>Let us not despise the gem because it has been broken to
fragments, obscured by silt and mud.&nbsp; Still less let us
fancy that one least fragment of it is not more precious than the
most brilliant paste jewel of our own compounding, though it be
polished and faceted never so completely.&nbsp; For what are all
these myths but fragments of that great metaphysic idea, which, I
boldly say, I believe to be at once the justifier and the
harmoniser of all philosophic truth which man has ever
discovered, or will discover; which Philo saw partially, and yet
clearly; which the Hebrew sages perceived far more deeply,
because more humanly and practically; which Saint Paul the
Platonist, and yet the Apostle, raised to its highest power, when
he declared that the immutable and self-existent Being, for whom
the Greek sages sought, and did not altogether seek in vain, has
gathered together all things both in heaven and in earth in one
inspiring and creating Logos, who is both God and Man?</p>
<p>Be this as it may, we find that from the time of Philo, the
deepest thought of the heathen world began to flow in a theologic
channel.&nbsp; All the great heathen thinkers henceforth are
theologians.&nbsp; In the times of Nero, for instance, Epictetus
the slave, the regenerator of Stoicism, is no mere speculator
concerning entities and quiddities, correct or incorrect.&nbsp;
He is a slave searching for the secret of freedom, and finding
that it consists in escaping not from a master, but from self:
not to wealth and power, but to Jove.&nbsp; He discovers that
Jove is, in some most mysterious, but most real sense, the Father
of men; he learns to look up to that Father as his guide and
friend.</p>
<p>Numenius, again, in the second century, was a man who had
evidently studied Philo.&nbsp; He perceived so deeply, I may say
so exaggeratedly, the analogy between the Jewish and the Platonic
assertions of an Absolute and Eternal Being, side by side with
the assertion of a Divine Teacher of man, that he is said to have
uttered the startling saying: &ldquo;What is Plato but Moses
talking Attic?&rdquo;&nbsp; Doubtless Plato is not that: but the
expression is remarkable, as showing the tendency of the
age.&nbsp; He too looks up to God with prayers for the guidance
of his reason.&nbsp; He too enters into speculation concerning
God in His absoluteness, and in His connection with the
universe.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Primary God,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;must be free from works and a King; but the Demiurgus must
exercise government, going through the heavens.&nbsp; Through Him
comes this our condition; through Him Reason being sent down in
efflux, holds communion with all who are prepared for it: God
then looking down, and turning Himself to each of us, it comes to
pass that our bodies live and are nourished, receiving strength
from the outer rays which come from Him.&nbsp; But when God turns
us to the contemplation of Himself, it comes to pass that these
things are worn out and consumed, but that the reason lives,
being partaker of a blessed life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This passage is exceedingly interesting, as containing both
the marrow of old Hebrew metaphysic, and also certain notional
elements, of which we find no trace in the Scripture, and which
may lead&mdash;as we shall find they afterwards did lead&mdash;to
confusing the moral with the notional, and finally the notional
with the material; in plain words, to Pantheism.</p>
<p>You find this tendency, in short, in all the philosophers who
flourished between the age of Augustus and the rise of
Alexandrian Neoplatonism.&nbsp; Gibbon, while he gives an
approving pat on the back to his pet &ldquo;Philosophic
Emperor,&rdquo; Marcus Aurelius, blinks the fact that
Marcus&rsquo;s philosophy, like that of Plutarch, contains as an
integral element, a belief which to him would have been, I fear,
simply ludicrous, from its strange analogy with the belief of
John, the Christian Apostle.&nbsp; What is Marcus
Aurelius&rsquo;s cardinal doctrine?&nbsp; That there is a God
within him, a Word, a Logos, which &ldquo;has hold of him,&rdquo;
and who is his teacher and guardian; that over and above his body
and his soul, he has a Reason which is capable of &ldquo;hearing
that Divine Word, and obeying the monitions of that
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is Plutarch&rsquo;s cardinal
doctrine?&nbsp; That the same Word, the D&aelig;mon who spoke to
the heart of Socrates, is speaking to him and to every
philosopher; &ldquo;coming into contact,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;with him in some wonderful manner;&rdquo; addressing the
reason of those who, like Socrates, keep their reason pure, not
under the dominion of passion, nor mixing itself greatly with the
body, and therefore quick and sensitive in responding to that
which encountered it.</p>
<p>You see from these two extracts what questions were arising in
the minds of men, and how they touched on ethical and theological
questions.&nbsp; I say arising in their minds: I believe that I
ought to say rather, stirred up in their minds by One greater
than they.&nbsp; At all events, there they appeared, utterly
independent of any Christian teaching.&nbsp; The belief in this
Logos or D&aelig;mon speaking to the Reason of man, was one which
neither Plutarch nor Marcus, neither Numenius nor Ammonius, as
far as we can see, learnt from the Christians; it was the common
ground which they held with them; the common battlefield which
they disputed with them.</p>
<p>Neither have we any reason to suppose that they learnt it from
the Hindoos.&nbsp; That much Hindoo thought mixed with
Neoplatonist speculation we cannot doubt; but there is not a jot
more evidence to prove that Alexandrians borrowed this conception
from the Mahabharavata, than that George Fox the Quaker, or the
author of the &ldquo;Deutsche Theologie,&rdquo; did so.&nbsp;
They may have gone to Hindoo philosophy, or rather, to second and
third hand traditions thereof, for corroborations of the belief;
but be sure, it must have existed in their own hearts first, or
they would never have gone thither.&nbsp; Believe it; be sure of
it.&nbsp; No earnest thinker is a plagiarist pure and
simple.&nbsp; He will never borrow from others that which he has
not already, more or less, thought out for himself.&nbsp; When
once a great idea, instinctive, inductive (for the two
expressions are nearer akin than most fancy), has dawned on his
soul, he will welcome lovingly, awfully, any corroboration from
foreign schools, and cry with joy: &ldquo;Behold, this is not
altogether a dream: for others have found it also.&nbsp; Surely
it must be real, universal, eternal.&rdquo;&nbsp; No; be sure
there is far more originality (in the common sense of the word),
and far less (in the true sense of the word), than we fancy; and
that it is a paltry and shallow doctrine which represents each
succeeding school as merely the puppets and dupes of the
preceding.&nbsp; More originality, because each earnest man seems
to think out for himself the deepest grounds of his creed.&nbsp;
Less originality, because, as I believe, one common Logos, Word,
Reason, reveals and unveils the same eternal truth to all who
seek and hunger for it.</p>
<p>Therefore we can, as the Christian philosophers of Alexandria
did, rejoice over every truth which their heathen adversaries
beheld, and attribute them, as Clement does, to the highest
source, to the inspiration of the one and universal Logos.&nbsp;
With Clement, philosophy is only hurtful when it is untrue to
itself, and philosophy falsely so called; true philosophy is an
image of the truth, a divine gift bestowed on the Greeks.&nbsp;
The Bible, in his eyes, asserts that all forms of art and wisdom
are from God.&nbsp; The wise in mind have no doubt some peculiar
endowment of nature, but when they have offered themselves for
their work, they receive a spirit of perception from the Highest
Wisdom, giving them a new fitness for it.&nbsp; All severe study,
all cultivation of sympathy, are exercises of this spiritual
endowment.&nbsp; The whole intellectual discipline of the Greeks,
with their philosophy, came down from God to men.&nbsp;
Philosophy, he concludes in one place, carries on &ldquo;an
inquiry concerning Truth and the nature of Being; and this Truth
is that concerning which the Lord Himself said: &lsquo;I am the
Truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when the initiated find, or rather
receive, the true philosophy, they have it from the Truth itself;
that is from Him who is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While, then, these two schools had so many grounds in common,
where was their point of divergence?&nbsp; We shall find it, I
believe, fairly expressed in the dying words of Plotinus, the
great father of Neoplatonism.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am striving to bring
the God which is in us into harmony with the God which is in the
universe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether or not Plotinus actually so spoke,
that was what his disciples not only said that he spoke, but what
they would have wished him to speak.&nbsp; That one sentence
expresses the whole object of their philosophy.</p>
<p>But to that Pant&aelig;nus, Origen, Clement, and Augustine
would have answered: &ldquo;And we, on the other hand, assert
that the God which is in the universe, is the same as the God
which is in you, and is striving to bring you into harmony with
Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is the <i>experimentum
crucis</i>.&nbsp; There is the vast gulf between the Christian
and the Heathen schools, which when any man had overleaped, the
whole problem of the universe was from that moment
inverted.&nbsp; With Plotinus and his school man is seeking for
God: with Clement and his, God is seeking for man.&nbsp; With the
former, God is passive, and man active: with the latter, God is
active, man is passive&mdash;passive, that is, in so far as his
business is to listen when he is spoken to, to look at the light
which is unveiled to him, to submit himself to the inward laws
which he feels reproving and checking him at every turn, as
Socrates was reproved and checked by his inward D&aelig;mon.</p>
<p>Whether of these two theorems gives the higher conception
either of the Divine Being, or of man, I leave it for you to
judge.&nbsp; To those old Alexandrian Christians, a being who was
not seeking after every single creature, and trying to raise him,
could not be a Being of absolute Righteousness, Power, Love;
could not be a Being worthy of respect or admiration, even of
philosophic speculation.&nbsp; Human righteousness and love flows
forth disinterestedly to all around it, however unconscious,
however unworthy they may be; human power associated with
goodness, seeks for objects which it may raise and benefit by
that power.&nbsp; We must confess this, with the Christian
schools, or, with the Heathen schools, we must allow another
theory, which brought them into awful depths; which may bring any
generation which holds it into the same depths.</p>
<p>If Clement had asked the Neoplatonists: &ldquo;You believe,
Plotinus, in an absolutely Good Being.&nbsp; Do you believe that
it desires to shed forth its goodness on all?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; they would have answered, &ldquo;on
those who seek for it, on the philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not, it seems, Plotinus, on the herd, the brutal,
ignorant mass, wallowing in those foul crimes above which you
have risen?&rdquo;&nbsp; And at that question there would have
been not a little hesitation.&nbsp; These brutes in human form,
these souls wallowing in earthly mire, could hardly, in the
Neoplatonists&rsquo; eyes, be objects of the Divine desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this Absolute Good, you say, Plotinus, has no
relation with them, no care to raise them.&nbsp; In fact, it
cannot raise them, because they have nothing in common with
it.&nbsp; Is that your notion?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Neoplatonists
would have, on the whole, allowed that argument.&nbsp; And if
Clement had answered, that such was not his notion of Goodness,
or of a Good Being, and that therefore the goodness of their
Absolute Good, careless of the degradation and misery around it,
must be something very different from his notions of human
goodness; the Neoplatonists would have answered&mdash;indeed they
did answer&mdash;&ldquo;After all, why not?&nbsp; Why should the
Absolute Goodness be like our human goodness?&rdquo;&nbsp; This
is Plotinus&rsquo;s own belief.&nbsp; It is a question with him,
it was still more a question with those who came after him,
whether virtues could be predicated of the Divine nature;
courage, for instance, of one who had nothing to fear;
self-restraint, of one who had nothing to desire.&nbsp; And thus,
by setting up a different standard of morality for the divine and
for the human, Plotinus gradually arrives at the conclusion, that
virtue is not the end, but the means; not the Divine nature
itself, as the Christian schools held, but only the purgative
process by which man was to ascend into heaven, and which was
necessary to arrive at that nature&mdash;that nature itself
being&mdash;what?</p>
<p>And how to answer that last question was the abysmal problem
of the whole of Neoplatonic philosophy, in searching for which it
wearied itself out, generation after generation, till tired
equally of seeking and of speaking, it fairly lay down and
died.&nbsp; In proportion as it refused to acknowledge a common
divine nature with the degraded mass, it deserted its first
healthy instinct, which told it that the spiritual world is
identical with the moral world, with right, love, justice; it
tried to find new definitions for the spiritual; it conceived it
to be identical with the intellectual.&nbsp; That did not satisfy
its heart.&nbsp; It had to repeople the spiritual world, which it
had emptied of its proper denizens, with ghosts; to reinvent the
old d&aelig;monologies and polytheisms&mdash;from thence to
descend into lower depths, of which we will speak hereafter.</p>
<p>But in the meanwhile we must look at another quarrel which
arose between the two twin schools of Alexandria.&nbsp; The
Neoplatonists said that there is a divine element in man.&nbsp;
The Christian philosophers assented fervently, and raised the old
disagreeable question: &ldquo;Is it in every man?&nbsp; In the
publicans and harlots as well as in the philosophers?&nbsp; We
say that it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there again the Neoplatonist
finds it over hard to assent to a doctrine, equally contrary to
outward appearance, and galling to Pharisaic pride; and enters
into a hundred honest self-puzzles and self-contradictions, which
seem to justify him at last in saying, No.&nbsp; It is in the
philosopher, who is ready by nature, as Plotinus has it, and as
it were furnished with wings, and not needing to sever himself
from matter like the rest, but disposed already to ascend to that
which is above.&nbsp; And in a degree too, it is in the
&ldquo;lover,&rdquo; who, according to Plotinus, has a certain
innate recollection of beauty, and hovers round it, and desires
it, wherever he sees it.&nbsp; Him you may raise to the
apprehension of the one incorporeal Beauty, by teaching him to
separate beauty from the various objects in which it appears
scattered and divided.&nbsp; And it is even in the third class,
the lowest of whom there is hope, namely, the musical man,
capable of being passively affected by beauty, without having any
active appetite for it; the sentimentalist, in short, as we
should call him nowadays.</p>
<p>But for the herd, Plotinus cannot say that there is anything
divine in them.&nbsp; And thus it gradually comes out in all
Neoplatonist writings which I have yet examined, that the Divine
only exists in a man, in proportion as he is conscious of its
existence in him.&nbsp; From which spring two conceptions of the
Divine in man.&nbsp; First, is it a part of him, if it is
dependent for its existence on his consciousness of it? Or is it,
as Philo, Plutarch, Marcus Aurelius would have held, as the
Christians held, something independent of him, without him, a
Logos or Word speaking to his reason and conscience?&nbsp; With
this question Plotinus grapples, earnestly, shrewdly,
fairly.&nbsp; If you wish to see how he does it, you should read
the fourth and fifth books of the sixth Ennead, especially if you
be lucky enough to light on a copy of that rare book,
Taylor&rsquo;s faithful though crabbed translation.</p>
<p>Not that the result of his search is altogether
satisfactory.&nbsp; He enters into subtle and severe
disquisitions concerning soul.&nbsp; Whether it is one or
many.&nbsp; How it can be both one and many.&nbsp; He has the
strongest perception that, to use the noble saying of the
Germans, &ldquo;Time and Space are no gods.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sees
clearly that the soul, and the whole unseen world of truly
existing being, is independent of time and space: and yet, after
he has wrestled with the two Titans, through page after page, and
apparently conquered them, they slip in again unawares into the
battle-field, the moment his back is turned.&nbsp; He denies that
the one Reason has parts&mdash;it must exist as a whole
wheresoever it exists: and yet he cannot express the relation of
the individual soul to it, but by saying that we are parts of it;
or that each thing, down to the lowest, receives as much soul as
it is capable of possessing.&nbsp; Ritter has worked out at
length, though in a somewhat dry and lifeless way, the hundred
contradictions of this kind which you meet in Plotinus;
contradictions which I suspect to be inseparable from any
philosophy starting from his grounds.&nbsp; Is he not looking for
the spiritual in a region where it does not exist; in the region
of logical conceptions and abstractions, which are not realities,
but only, after all, symbols of our own, whereby we express to
ourselves the processes of our own brain?&nbsp; May not his
Christian contemporaries have been nearer scientific truth, as
well as nearer the common sense and practical belief of mankind,
in holding that that which is spiritual is personal, and can only
be seen or conceived of as residing in persons; and that that
which is personal is moral, and has to do, not with abstractions
of the intellect, but with right and wrong, love and hate, and
all which, in the common instincts of men, involves a free will,
a free judgment, a free responsibility and desert? And that,
therefore, if there were a Spirit, a D&aelig;monic Element, an
universal Reason, a Logos, a Divine Element, closely connected
with man, that one Reason, that one Divine Element, must be a
person also?&nbsp; At least, so strong was the instinct of even
the Heathen schools in this direction, that the followers of
Plotinus had to fill up the void which yawned between man and the
invisible things after which he yearned, by reviving the whole
old Pagan Polytheism, and adding to it a D&aelig;monology
borrowed partly from the Chaldees, and partly from the Jewish
rabbis, which formed a descending chain of persons, downward from
the highest Deities to heroes, and to the guardian angel of each
man; the meed of the philosopher being, that by self-culture and
self-restraint he could rise above the tutelage of some lower and
more earthly d&aelig;mon, and become the pupil of a God, and
finally a God himself.</p>
<p>These contradictions need not lower the great Father of
Neoplatonism in our eyes, as a moral being.&nbsp; All accounts of
him seem to prove him to have been what Apollo, in a lengthy
oracle, declared him to have been, &ldquo;good and gentle, and
benignant exceedingly, and pleasant in all his
conversation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave good advice about earthly
matters, was a faithful steward of moneys deposited with him, a
guardian of widows and orphans, a righteous and loving man.&nbsp;
In his practical life, the ascetic and gnostic element comes out
strongly enough.&nbsp; The body, with him, was not evil, neither
was it good; it was simply nothing&mdash;why care about it? He
would have no portrait taken of his person: &ldquo;It was
humiliating enough to be obliged to carry a shadow about with
him, without having a shadow made of that shadow.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
refused animal food, abstained from baths, declined medicine in
his last illness, and so died about 200 <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span></p>
<p>It is in his followers, as one generally sees in such cases,
that the weakness of his conceptions comes out.&nbsp; Plotinus
was an earnest thinker, slavishly enough reverencing the opinion
of Plato, whom he quotes as an infallible oracle, with a
&ldquo;He says,&rdquo; as if there were but one he in the
universe: but he tried honestly to develop Plato, or what he
conceived to be Plato, on the method which Plato had laid
down.&nbsp; His dialectic is far superior, both in quantity and
in quality, to that of those who come after him.&nbsp; He is a
seeker.&nbsp; His followers are not.&nbsp; The great work which
marks the second stage of his school is not an inquiry, but a
justification, not only of the Egyptian, but of all possible
theurgies and superstitions; perhaps the best attempt of the kind
which the world has ever seen; that which marks the third is a
mere cloud-castle, an inverted pyramid, not of speculation, but
of dogmatic assertion, patched together from all accessible rags
and bones of the dead world.&nbsp; Some here will, perhaps, guess
from my rough descriptions, that I speak of Iamblichus and
Proclus.</p>
<p>Whether or not Iamblichus wrote the famous work usually
attributed to him, which describes itself as the letter of
Abamnon the Teacher to Porphyry, he became the head of that
school of Neoplatonists who fell back on theurgy and magic, and
utterly swallowed up the more rational, though more hopeless,
school of Porphyry.&nbsp; Not that Porphyry, too, with all his
dislike of magic and the vulgar superstitions&mdash;a dislike
intimately connected with his loudly expressed dislike of the
common herd, and therefore of Christianity, as a religion for the
common herd&mdash;did not believe a fact or two, which looks to
us, nowadays, somewhat unphilosophical.&nbsp; From him we learn
that one Ammonius, trying to crush Plotinus by magic arts, had
his weapons so completely turned against himself, that all his
limbs were contracted.&nbsp; From him we learn that Plotinus,
having summoned in the temple of Isis his familiar spirit, a god,
and not a mere d&aelig;mon, appeared.&nbsp; He writes sensibly
enough however to one Anebos, an Egyptian priest, stating his
doubts as to the popular notions of the Gods, as beings subject
to human passions and vices, and of theurgy and magic, as
material means of compelling them to appear, or alluring them to
favour man.&nbsp; The answer of Abamnon, Anebos, Iamblichus, or
whoever the real author may have been, is worthy of perusal by
every metaphysical student, as a curious phase of thought, not
confined to that time, but rife, under some shape or other, in
every age of the world&rsquo;s history, and in this as much as in
any.&nbsp; There are many passages full of eloquence, many more
full of true and noble thought: but on the whole, it is the
sewing of new cloth into an old garment; the attempt to suit the
old superstition to the new one, by eclectically picking and
choosing, and special pleading, on both sides; but the rent is
only made worse.&nbsp; There is no base superstition which
Abamnon does not unconsciously justify.&nbsp; And yet he is
rapidly losing sight of the real eternal human germs of truth
round which those superstitions clustered, and is really further
from truth and reason than old Homer or Hesiod, because further
from the simple, universal, everyday facts, and relations, and
duties of man, which are, after all, among the most mysterious,
and also among the most sacred objects which man can
contemplate.</p>
<p>It was not wonderful, however, that Neoplatonism took the
course it did.&nbsp; Spirit, they felt rightly, was meant to rule
matter; it was to be freed from matter only for that very
purpose.&nbsp; No one could well deny that.&nbsp; The
philosopher, as he rose and became, according to Plotinus, a god,
or at least approached toward the gods, must partake of some
mysterious and transcendental power.&nbsp; No one could well deny
that conclusion, granting the premiss.&nbsp; But of what
power?&nbsp; What had he to show as the result of his intimate
communion with an unseen Being?&nbsp; The Christian Schools, who
held that the spiritual is the moral, answered accordingly.&nbsp;
He must show righteousness, and love, and peace in a Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; That is the likeness of God.&nbsp; In proportion as
a man has them, he is partaker of a Divine nature.&nbsp; He can
rise no higher, and he needs no more.&nbsp; Platonists had
said&mdash;No, that is only virtue; and virtue is the means, not
the end.&nbsp; We want proof of having something above that;
something more than any man of the herd, any Christian slave, can
perform; something above nature; portents and wonders.&nbsp; So
they set to work to perform wonders; and succeeded, I suppose,
more or less.&nbsp; For now one enters into a whole fairyland of
those very phenomena which are puzzling us so
nowadays&mdash;ecstasy, clairvoyance, insensibility to pain,
cures produced by the effect of what we now call mesmerism.&nbsp;
They are all there, these modern puzzles, in those old books of
the long bygone seekers for wisdom.&nbsp; It makes us love them,
while it saddens us to see that their difficulties were the same
as ours, and that there is nothing new under the sun.&nbsp; Of
course, a great deal of it all was
&ldquo;imagination.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the question then, as now
is, what is this wonder-working imagination?&mdash;unless the
word be used as a mere euphemism for lying, which really, in many
cases, is hardly fair.&nbsp; We cannot wonder at the old
Neoplatonists for attributing these strange phenomena to
spiritual influence, when we see some who ought to know better
doing the same thing now; and others, who more wisely believe
them to be strictly physical and nervous, so utterly unable to
give reasons for them, that they feel it expedient to ignore them
for awhile, till they know more about those physical phenomena
which can be put under some sort of classification, and
attributed to some sort of inductive law.</p>
<p>But again.&nbsp; These ecstasies, cures, and so forth, brought
them rapidly back to the old priestcrafts.&nbsp; The Egyptian
priests, the Babylonian and Jewish sorcerers, had practised all
this as a trade for ages, and reduced it to an art.&nbsp; It was
by sleeping in the temples of the deities, after due mesmeric
manipulations, that cures were even then effected.&nbsp; Surely
the old priests were the people to whom to go for
information.&nbsp; The old philosophers of Greece were
venerable.&nbsp; How much more those of the East, in comparison
with whom the Greeks were children?&nbsp; Besides, if these
d&aelig;mons and deities were so near them, might it not be
possible to behold them?&nbsp; They seemed to have given up
caring much for the world and its course&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effugerant
adytis templisque relictis<br />
D&icirc; quibus imperium steterat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old priests used to make them appear&mdash;perhaps they
might do it again.&nbsp; And if spirit could act directly and
preternaturally on matter, in spite of the laws of matter,
perhaps matter might act on spirit.&nbsp; After all, were matter
and spirit so absolutely different?&nbsp; Was not spirit some
sort of pervading essence, some subtle ethereal fluid, differing
from matter principally in being less gross and dense?&nbsp; This
was the point to which they went down rapidly enough; the point
to which all philosophies, I firmly believe, will descend, which
do not keep in sight that the spiritual means the moral.&nbsp; In
trying to make it mean exclusively the intellectual, they will
degrade it to mean the merely logical and abstract; and when that
is found to be a barren and lifeless phantom, a mere projection
of the human brain, attributing reality to mere conceptions and
names, and confusing the subject with the object, as logicians
say truly the Neoplatonists did, then in despair, the school will
try to make the spiritual something real, or, at least, something
conceivable, by reinvesting it with the properties of matter, and
talking of it as if it were some manner of gas, or heat, or
electricity, or force, pervading time and space, conditioned by
the accidents of brute matter, and a part of that nature which is
born to die.</p>
<p>The culmination of all this confusion we see in Proclus.&nbsp;
The unfortunate Hypatia, who is the most important personage
between him and Iamblichus, has left no writings to our times; we
can only judge of her doctrine by that of her instructors and her
pupils.&nbsp; Proclus was taught by the men who had heard her
lecture; and the golden chain of the Platonic succession
descended from her to him.&nbsp; His throne, however, was at
Athens, not at Alexandria.&nbsp; After the murder of the maiden
philosopher, Neoplatonism prudently retired to Greece.&nbsp; But
Proclus is so essentially the child of the Alexandrian school
that we cannot pass him over.&nbsp; Indeed, according to M.
Cousin, as I am credibly informed, he is <i>the</i> Greek
philosopher; the flower and crown of all its schools; in whom,
says the learned Frenchman, &ldquo;are combined, and from whom
shine forth, in no irregular or uncertain rays, Orpheus,
Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Plotinus, Porphyry, and
Iamblichus;&rdquo; and who &ldquo;had so comprehended all
religions in his mind, and paid them such equal reverence, that
he was, as it were, the priest of the whole universe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have not the honour of knowing much of M. Cousin&rsquo;s
works.&nbsp; I never came across them but on one small matter of
fact, and on that I found him copying at second hand an
anachronism which one would have conceived palpable to any reader
of the original authorities.&nbsp; This is all I know of him,
saving these his raptures over Proclus, of which I have quoted
only a small portion, and of which I can only say, in Mr. Thomas
Carlyle&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;What things men will worship, in
their extreme need!&rdquo; Other moderns, however, have expressed
their admiration of Proclus; and, no doubt, many neat sayings may
be found in him (for after all he was a Greek), which will be
both pleasing and useful to those who consider philosophic method
to consist in putting forth strings of brilliant apophthegms,
careless about either their consistency or coherence: but of the
method of Plato or Aristotle, any more than of that of Kant or
Mill, you will find nothing in him.&nbsp; He seems to my
simplicity to be at once the most timid and servile of
commentators, and the most cloudy of declaimers.&nbsp; He can
rave symbolism like Jacob B&ouml;hmen, but without an atom of his
originality and earnestness.&nbsp; He can develop an inverted
pyramid of d&aelig;monology, like Father Newman himself, but
without an atom of his art, his knowledge of human
cravings.&nbsp; He combines all schools, truly, Chaldee and
Egyptian as well as Greek; but only scraps from their mummies,
drops from their quintessences, which satisfy the heart and
conscience as little as they do the logical faculties.&nbsp; His
Greek gods and heroes, even his Alcibiades and Socrates, are
&ldquo;ideas;&rdquo; that is, symbols of certain notions or
qualities: their flesh and bones, their heart and brain, have
been distilled away, till nothing is left but a word, a notion,
which may patch a hole in his huge heaven-and-earth-embracing
system.&nbsp; He, too, is a commentator and a deducer; all has
been discovered; and he tries to discover nothing more.&nbsp;
Those who followed him seem to have commented on his
comments.&nbsp; With him Neoplatonism properly ends.&nbsp; Is its
last utterance a culmination or a fall?&nbsp; Have the Titans
sealed heaven, or died of old age, &ldquo;exhibiting,&rdquo; as
Gibbon says of them, &ldquo;a deplorable instance of the senility
of the human mind?&rdquo; Read Proclus, and judge for yourselves:
but first contrive to finish everything else you have to do which
can possibly be useful to any human being.&nbsp; Life is short,
and Art&mdash;at least the art of obtaining practical guidance
from the last of the Alexandrians&mdash;very long.</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;if Proclus and his school became gradually
unfaithful to the great root-idea of their philosophy, we must
not imitate them.&nbsp; We must not believe that the last of the
Alexandrians was under no divine teaching, because he had
be-systemed himself into confused notions of what that teaching
was like.&nbsp; Yes, there was good in poor old Proclus; and it
too came from the only source whence all good comes.&nbsp; Were
there no good in him I could not laugh at him as I have done; I
could only hate him.&nbsp; There are moments when he rises above
his theories; moments when he recurs in spirit, if not in the
letter, to the faith of Homer, almost to the faith of
Philo.&nbsp; Whether these are the passages of his which his
modern admirers prize most, I cannot tell.&nbsp; I should fancy
not: nevertheless I will read you one of them.</p>
<p>He is about to commence his discourses on the Parmenides, that
book in which we generally now consider that Plato has been most
untrue to himself, and fallen from his usual inductive method to
the ground of a mere <i>&agrave; priori</i> theoriser&mdash;and
yet of which Proclus is reported to have said, and, I should
conceive, said honestly, that if it, the Tim&aelig;us, and the
Orphic fragments were preserved, he did not care whether every
other book on earth were destroyed.&nbsp; But how does he
commence?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray to all the gods and goddesses to guide my reason
in the speculation which lies before me, and having kindled in me
the pure light of truth, to direct my mind upward to the very
knowledge of the things which are, and to open the doors of my
soul to receive the divine guidance of Plato, and, having
directed my knowledge into the very brightness of being, to
withdraw me from the various forms of opinion, from the apparent
wisdom, from the wandering about things which do not exist, by
that purest intellectual exercise about the things which do
exist, whereby alone the eye of the soul is nourished and
brightened, as Socrates says in the Ph&aelig;drus; and that the
Noetic Gods will give to me the perfect reason, and the Noeric
Gods the power which leads up to this, and that the rulers of the
Universe above the heaven will impart to me an energy unshaken by
material notions and emancipated from them, and those to whom the
world is given as their dominion a winged life, and the angelic
choirs a true manifestation of divine things, and the good
d&aelig;mons the fulness of the inspiration which comes from the
Gods, and the heroes a grand, and venerable, and lofty fixedness
of mind, and the whole divine race together a perfect preparation
for sharing in Plato&rsquo;s most mystical and far-seeing
speculations, which he declares to us himself in the Parmenides,
with the profundity befitting such topics, but which <i>he</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> his master Syrianus) completed by his most pure and
luminous apprehensions, who did most truly share the Platonic
feast, and was the medium for transmitting the divine truth, the
guide in our speculations, and the hierophant of these divine
words; who, as I think, came down as a type of philosophy, to do
good to the souls that are here, in place of idols, sacrifices,
and the whole mystery of purification, a leader of salvation to
the men who are now and who shall be hereafter.&nbsp; And may the
whole band of those who are above us be propitious; and may the
whole force which they supply be at hand, kindling before us that
light which, proceeding from them, may guide us to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely this is an interesting document.&nbsp; The last Pagan
Greek prayer, I believe, which we have on record; the death-wail
of the old world&mdash;not without a touch of melody.&nbsp; One
cannot altogether admire the style; it is inflated, pedantic,
written, I fear, with a considerable consciousness that he was
saying the right thing and in the very finest way: but still it
is a prayer.&nbsp; A cry for light&mdash;by no means, certainly,
like that noble one in Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;In
Memoriam:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>So runs my dream.&nbsp; But what am I?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An infant crying in the night;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An infant crying for the light;<br />
And with no language but a cry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet he asks for light: perhaps he had settled already for
himself&mdash;like too many more of us&mdash;what sort of light
he chose to have: but still the eye is turned upward to the sun,
not inward in conceited fancy that self is its own
illumination.&nbsp; He asks&mdash;surely not in vain.&nbsp; There
was light to be had for asking.&nbsp; That prayer certainly was
not answered in the letter: it may have been ere now in the
spirit.&nbsp; And yet it is a sad prayer enough.&nbsp; Poor old
man, and poor old philosophy!</p>
<p>This he and his teachers had gained by despising the simpler
and yet far profounder doctrine of the Christian schools, that
the Logos, the Divine Teacher in whom both Christians and
Heathens believed, was the very archetype of men, and that He had
proved that fact by being made flesh, and dwelling bodily among
them, that they might behold His glory, full of grace and truth,
and see that it was at once the perfection of man and the
perfection of God: that that which was most divine was most
human, and that which was most human, most divine.&nbsp; That was
the outcome of <i>their</i> metaphysic, that they had found the
Absolute One; because One existed in whom the apparent antagonism
between that which is eternally and that which becomes in time,
between the ideal and the actual, between the spiritual and the
material, in a word, between God and man, was explained and
reconciled for ever.</p>
<p>And Proclus&rsquo;s prayer, on the other hand, was the outcome
of the Neoplatonists&rsquo; metaphysic, the end of all
<i>their</i> search after the One, the Indivisible, the Absolute,
this cry to all manner of innumerable phantoms, ghosts of ideas,
ghosts of traditions, neither things nor persons, but thoughts,
to give the philosopher each something or other, according to the
nature of each.&nbsp; Not that he very clearly defines what each
is to give him; but still he feels himself in want of all manner
of things, and it is as well to have as many friends at court as
possible&mdash;Noetic Gods, Noeric Gods, rulers, angels,
d&aelig;mons, heroes&mdash;to enable him to do what?&nbsp; To
understand Plato&rsquo;s most mystical and far-seeing
speculations.&nbsp; The Eternal Nous, the Intellectual Teacher
has vanished further and further off; further off still some dim
vision of a supreme Goodness.&nbsp; Infinite spaces above that
looms through the mist of the abyss a Prim&aelig;val One.&nbsp;
But even that has a predicate, for it is one; it is not pure
essence.&nbsp; Must there not be something beyond that again,
which is not even one, but is nameless, inconceivable,
absolute?&nbsp; What an abyss!&nbsp; How shall the human mind
find anything whereon to rest, in the vast nowhere between it and
the object of its search?&nbsp; The search after the One issues
in a wail to the innumerable; and kind gods, angels, and heroes,
not human indeed, but still conceivable enough to satisfy at
least the imagination, step in to fill the void, as they have
done since, and may do again; and so, as Mr. Carlyle has it,
&ldquo;the bottomless pit got roofed over,&rdquo; as it may be
again ere long.</p>
<p>Are we then to say, that Neoplatonism was a failure?&nbsp;
That Alexandria, during four centuries of profound and earnest
thought, added nothing? Heaven forbid that we should say so of a
philosophy which has exercised on European thought, at the crisis
of its noblest life and action, an influence as great as did the
Aristotelian system during the Middle Ages.&nbsp; We must never
forget, that during the two centuries which commence with the
fall of Constantinople, and end with our civil wars, not merely
almost all great thinkers, but courtiers, statesmen, warriors,
poets, were more or less Neoplatonists.&nbsp; The Greek
grammarians, who migrated into Italy, brought with them the works
of Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Proclus; and their gorgeous reveries
were welcomed eagerly by the European mind, just revelling in the
free thought of youthful manhood.&nbsp; And yet the Alexandrian
impotence for any practical and social purposes was to be
manifested, as utterly as it was in Alexandria or in Athens of
old.&nbsp; Ficinus and Picus of Mirandola worked no deliverance,
either for Italian morals or polity, at a time when such
deliverance was needed bitterly enough.&nbsp; Neoplatonism was
petted by luxurious and heathen popes, as an elegant play of the
cultivated fancy, which could do their real power, their
practical system, neither good nor harm.&nbsp; And one cannot
help feeling, while reading the magnificent oration on
Supra-sensual Love, which Castiglione, in his admirable book
&ldquo;The Courtier,&rdquo; puts into the mouth of the profligate
Bembo, how near mysticism may lie not merely to dilettantism or
to Pharisaism, but to sensuality itself.&nbsp; But in England,
during Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, the practical weakness of
Neoplatonism was compensated by the noble practical life which
men were compelled to live in those great times; by the strong
hold which they had of the ideas of family and national life, of
law and personal faith.&nbsp; And I cannot but believe it to have
been a mighty gain to such men as Sidney, Raleigh, and Spenser,
that they had drunk, however slightly, of the wells of Proclus
and Plotinus.&nbsp; One cannot read Spenser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fairy
Queen,&rdquo; above all his Garden of Adonis, and his cantos on
Mutability, without feeling that his Neoplatonism must have kept
him safe from many a dark eschatological superstition, many a
narrow and bitter dogmatism, which was even then tormenting the
English mind, and must have helped to give him altogether a freer
and more loving conception, if not a consistent or accurate one,
of the wondrous harmony of that mysterious analogy between the
physical and the spiritual, which alone makes poetry (and I had
almost said philosophy also) possible, and have taught him to
behold alike in suns and planets, in flowers and insects, in man
and in beings higher than man, one glorious order of love and
wisdom, linking them all to Him from whom they all proceed, rays
from His cloudless sunlight, mirrors of His eternal glory.</p>
<p>But as the Elizabethan age, exhausted by its own fertility,
gave place to the Caroline, Neoplatonism ran through much the
same changes.&nbsp; It was good for us, after all, that the plain
strength of the Puritans, unphilosophical as they were, swept it
away.&nbsp; One feels in reading the later Neoplatonists, Henry
More, Smith, even Cudworth (valuable as he is), that the old
accursed distinction between the philosopher, the scholar, the
illuminate, and the plain righteous man, was growing up again
very fast.&nbsp; The school from which the &ldquo;Religio
Medici&rdquo; issued was not likely to make any bad men good, or
any foolish men wise.</p>
<p>Besides, as long as men were continuing to quote poor old
Proclus as an irrefragable authority, and believing that he,
forsooth, represented the sense of Plato, the new-born Baconian
philosophy had but little chance in the world.&nbsp; Bacon had
been right in his dislike of Platonism years before, though he
was unjust to Plato himself.&nbsp; It was Proclus whom he was
really reviling; Proclus as Plato&rsquo;s commentator and
representative.&nbsp; The lion had for once got into the
ass&rsquo;s skin, and was treated accordingly.&nbsp; The true
Platonic method, that dialectic which the Alexandrians gradually
abandoned, remains yet to be tried, both in England and in
Germany; and I am much mistaken, if, when fairly used, it be not
found the ally, not the enemy, of the Baconian philosophy; in
fact, the inductive method applied to words, as the expressions
of Metaphysic Laws, instead of to natural phenomena, as the
expressions of Physical ones.&nbsp; If you wish to see the
highest instances of this method, read Plato himself, not
Proclus.&nbsp; If you wish to see how the same method can be
applied to Christian truth, read the dialectic passages in
Augustine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Confessions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether or not
you shall agree with their conclusions, you will not be likely,
if you have a truly scientific habit of mind, to complain that
they want either profundity, severity, or simplicity.</p>
<p>So concludes the history of one of the Alexandrian schools of
Metaphysic.&nbsp; What was the fate of the other is a subject
which I must postpone to my next Lecture.</p>
<h2>LECTURE IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CROSS AND THE CRESCENT.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">tried</span> to point out, in my last
Lecture, the causes which led to the decay of the Pagan
metaphysic of Alexandria.&nbsp; We have now to consider the fate
of the Christian school.</p>
<p>You may have remarked that I have said little or nothing about
the positive dogmas of Clement, Origen, and their disciples; but
have only brought out the especial points of departure between
them and the Heathens.&nbsp; My reason for so doing was twofold:
first, I could not have examined them without entering on
controversial ground; next, I am very desirous to excite some of
my hearers, at least, to examine these questions for
themselves.</p>
<p>I entreat them not to listen to the hasty sneer to which many
of late have given way, that the Alexandrian divines were mere
mystics, who corrupted Christianity by an admixture of Oriental
and Greek thought.&nbsp; My own belief is that they expanded and
corroborated Christianity, in spite of great errors and defects
on certain points, far more than they corrupted it; that they
presented it to the minds of cultivated and scientific men in the
only form in which it would have satisfied their philosophic
aspirations, and yet contrived, with wonderful wisdom, to ground
their philosophy on the very same truths which they taught to the
meanest slaves, and to appeal in the philosophers to the same
inward faculty to which they appealed in the slave; namely, to
that inward eye, that moral sense and reason, whereby each and
every man can, if he will, &ldquo;judge of himself that which is
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; I boldly say that I believe the Alexandrian
Christians to have made the best, perhaps the only, attempt yet
made by men, to proclaim a true world-philosophy; whereby I mean
a philosophy common to all races, ranks, and intellects,
embracing the whole phenomena of humanity, and not an arbitrarily
small portion of them, and capable of being understood and
appreciated by every human being from the highest to the
lowest.&nbsp; And when you hear of a system of reserve in
teaching, a <i>disciplina arcani</i>, of an esoteric and
exoteric, an inner and outer school, among these men, you must
not be frightened at the words, as if they spoke of priestcraft,
or an intellectual aristocracy, who kept the kernel of the nut
for themselves, and gave the husks to the mob.&nbsp; It was not
so with the Christian schools; it was so with the Heathen
ones.&nbsp; The Heathens were content that the mob, the herd,
should have the husks.&nbsp; Their avowed intention and wish was
to leave the herd, as they called them, in the mere outward
observance of the old idolatries, while they themselves, the
cultivated philosophers, had the monopoly of those deeper
spiritual truths which were contained under the old
superstitions, and were too sacred to be profaned by the vulgar
eyes.&nbsp; The Christian method was the exact opposite.&nbsp;
They boldly called those vulgar eyes to enter into the very holy
of holies, and there gaze on the very deepest root-ideas of their
philosophy.&nbsp; They owned no ground for their own speculations
which was not common to the harlots and the slaves around.&nbsp;
And this was what enabled them to do this; this was what brought
on them the charge of demagogism, the hatred of philosophers, the
persecution of princes&mdash;that their ground was a moral
ground, and not a merely intellectual one; that they started, not
from any notions of the understanding, but from the inward
conscience, that truly pure Reason in which the intellectual and
the moral spheres are united, which they believed to exist,
however dimmed or crushed, in every human being, capable of being
awakened, purified, and raised up to a noble and heroic
life.&nbsp; They concealed nothing moral from their disciples:
only they forbade them to meddle with intellectual matters,
before they had had a regular intellectual training.&nbsp; The
witnesses of reason and conscience were sufficient guides for all
men, and at them the many might well stop short.&nbsp; The
teacher only needed to proceed further, not into a higher region,
but into a lower one, namely, into the region of the logical
understanding, and there make deductions from, and illustrations
of, those higher truths which he held in common with every slave,
and held on the same ground as they.</p>
<p>And the consequence of this method of philosophising was
patent.&nbsp; They were enabled to produce, in the lives of
millions, generation after generation, a more immense moral
improvement than the world had ever seen before.&nbsp; Their
disciples did actually become righteous and good men, just in
proportion as they were true to the lessons they learnt.&nbsp;
They did, for centuries, work a distinct and palpable deliverance
on the earth; while all the solemn and earnest meditation of the
Neoplatonists, however good or true, worked no deliverance
whatsoever.&nbsp; Plotinus longed at one time to make a practical
attempt.&nbsp; He asked the Emperor Gallienus, his patron, to
rebuild for him a city in Campania; to allow him to call it
Platonopolis, and put it into the hands of him and his disciples,
that they might there realise Plato&rsquo;s ideal republic.&nbsp;
Luckily for the reputation of Neoplatonism, the scheme was
swamped by the courtiers of Gallienus, and the earth was saved
the sad and ludicrous sight of a realised Laputa; probably a very
quarrelsome one.&nbsp; That was his highest practical conception:
the foundation of a new society: not the regeneration of society
as it existed.</p>
<p>That work was left for the Christian schools; and up to a
certain point they performed it.&nbsp; They made men good.&nbsp;
<i>This</i> was the test, which of the schools was in the right:
this was the test, which of the two had hold of the eternal roots
of metaphysic.&nbsp; Cicero says, that he had learnt more
philosophy from the Laws of the Twelve Tables than from all the
Greeks.&nbsp; Clement and his school might have said the same of
the Hebrew Ten Commandments and Jewish Law, which are so
marvellously analogous to the old Roman laws, founded, as they
are, on the belief in a Supreme Being, a Jupiter&mdash;literally
a Heavenly Father&mdash;who is the source and the sanction of
law; of whose justice man&rsquo;s justice is the pattern; who is
the avenger of crimes against marriage, property, life; on whom
depends the sanctity of an oath.&nbsp; And so, to compare great
things with small, there was a truly practical human element here
in the Christian teaching; purely ethical and metaphysical, and
yet palpable to the simplest and lowest, which gave to it a
regenerating force which the highest efforts of Neoplatonism
could never attain.</p>
<p>And yet Alexandrian Christianity, notoriously enough, rotted
away, and perished hideously.&nbsp; Most true.&nbsp; But what if
the causes of its decay and death were owing to its being untrue
to itself?</p>
<p>I do not say that they had no excuses for being untrue to
their own faith.&nbsp; We are not here to judge them.&nbsp; That
peculiar subtlety of mind, which rendered the Alexandrians the
great thinkers of the then world, had with Christians, as well as
Heathens, the effect of alluring them away from practice to
speculation.&nbsp; The Christian school, as was to be expected
from the moral ground of their philosophy, yielded to it far more
slowly than the Heathen, but they did yield, and especially after
they had conquered and expelled the Heathen school.&nbsp;
Moreover, the long battle with the Heathen school had stirred up
in them habits of exclusiveness, of denunciation; the spirit
which cannot assert a fact, without dogmatising rashly and
harshly on the consequences of denying that fact.&nbsp; Their
minds assumed a permanent habit of combativeness.&nbsp; Having no
more Heathens to fight, they began fighting each other,
excommunicating each other; denying to all who differed from them
any share of that light, to claim which for all men had been the
very ground of their philosophy.&nbsp; Not that they would have
refused the Logos to all men in words.&nbsp; They would have
cursed a man for denying the existence of the Logos in every man;
but they would have equally cursed him for acting on his
existence in practice, and treating the heretic as one who had
that within him to which a preacher might appeal.&nbsp; Thus they
became Dogmatists; that is, men who assert a truth so fiercely,
as to forget that a truth is meant to be used, and not merely
asserted&mdash;if, indeed, the fierce assertion of a truth in
frail man is not generally a sign of some secret doubt of it, and
in inverse proportion to his practical living faith in it: just
as he who is always telling you that he is a man, is not the most
likely to behave like a man.&nbsp; And why did this befall
them?&nbsp; Because they forgot practically that the light
proceeded from a Person.&nbsp; They could argue over notions and
dogmas deduced from the notion of His personality: but they were
shut up in those notions; they had forgotten that if He was a
Person, His eye was on them, His rule and kingdom within them;
and that if He was a Person, He had a character, and that that
character was a righteous and a loving character: and therefore
they were not ashamed, in defending these notions and dogmas
about Him, to commit acts abhorrent to His character, to lie, to
slander, to intrigue, to hate, even to murder, for the sake of
what they madly called His glory: but which was really only their
own glory&mdash;the glory of their own dogmas; of propositions
and conclusions in their own brain, which, true or false, were
equally heretical in their mouths, because they used them only as
watchwords of division.&nbsp; Orthodox or unorthodox, they lost
the knowledge of God, for they lost the knowledge of
righteousness, and love, and peace.&nbsp; That Divine Logos, and
theology as a whole, receded further and further aloft into
abysmal heights, as it became a mere dreary system of dead
scientific terms, having no practical bearing on their hearts and
lives; and then they, as the Neoplatonists had done before them,
filled up the void by those d&aelig;monologies, images, base
Fetish worships, which made the Mohammedan invaders regard them,
and I believe justly, as polytheists and idolaters, base as the
pagan Arabs of the desert.</p>
<p>I cannot but believe them, moreover, to have been untrue to
the teaching of Clement and his school, in that coarse and
materialist admiration of celibacy which ruined Alexandrian
society, as their dogmatic ferocity ruined Alexandrian
thought.&nbsp; The Creed which taught them that in the person of
the Incarnate Logos, that which was most divine had been proved
to be most human, that which was most human had been proved to be
most divine, ought surely to have given to them, as it has given
to modern Europe, nobler, clearer, simpler views of the true
relation of the sexes.&nbsp; However, on this matter they did not
see their way.&nbsp; Perhaps, in so debased an age, so profligate
a world, as that out of which Christianity had risen, it was
impossible to see the true beauty and sanctity of those primary
bonds of humanity.&nbsp; And while the relation of the sexes was
looked on in a wrong light, all other social relations were
necessarily also misconceived.&nbsp; &ldquo;The very ideas of
family and national life,&rdquo; as it has been said,
&ldquo;those two divine roots of the Church, severed from which
she is certain to wither away into that most cruel and most
godless of spectres, a religious world, had perished in the East,
from the evil influence of the universal practice of
slave-holding, as well as from the degradation of that Jewish
nation which had been for ages the great witness for these ideas;
and all classes, like their forefather Adam&mdash;like, indeed,
the Old Adam&mdash;the selfish, cowardly, brute nature in every
man and in every age&mdash;were shifting the blame of sin from
their own consciences to human relationships and duties, and
therein, to the God who had appointed them; and saying, as of
old, &lsquo;The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me
of the tree, and I did eat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much as Christianity did, even in Egypt, for woman, by
asserting her moral and spiritual equality with the man, there
seems to have been no suspicion that she was the true complement
of the man, not merely by softening him, but by strengthening
him; that true manhood can be no more developed without the
influence of the woman, than true womanhood without the influence
of the man.&nbsp; There is no trace among the Egyptian celibates
of that chivalrous woman-worship which our Gothic forefathers
brought with them into the West, which shed a softening and
ennobling light round the medi&aelig;val convent life, and warded
off for centuries the worst effects of monasticism.&nbsp; Among
the religious of Egypt, the monk regarded the nun, the nun the
monk, with dread and aversion; while both looked on the married
population of the opposite sex with a coarse contempt and disgust
which is hardly credible, did not the foul records of it stand
written to this day, in Rosweyde&rsquo;s extraordinary
&ldquo;Vit&aelig; Patrum Eremiticorum;&rdquo; no barren school of
metaphysic, truly, for those who are philosophic enough to
believe that all phenomena whatsoever of the human mind are
worthy matter for scientific induction.</p>
<p>And thus grew up in Egypt a monastic world, of such vastness
that it was said to equal in number the laity.&nbsp; This
produced, no doubt, an enormous increase in the actual amount of
moral evil.&nbsp; But it produced three other effects, which were
the ruin of Alexandria.&nbsp; First, a continually growing
enervation and numerical decrease of the population; next, a
carelessness of, and contempt for social and political life; and
lastly, a most brutalising effect on the lay population; who,
told that they were, and believing themselves to be, beings of a
lower order, and living by a lower standard, sank down more and
more generation after generation.&nbsp; They were of the world,
and the ways of the world they must follow.&nbsp; Political life
had no inherent sanctity or nobleness; why act holily and nobly
in it?&nbsp; Family life had no inherent sanctity or nobleness;
why act holily and nobly in it either, if there were no holy,
noble, and divine principle or ground for it?&nbsp; And thus grew
up, both in Egypt, Syria, and Byzantium, a chaos of profligacy
and chicanery, in rulers and people, in the home and the market,
in the theatre and the senate, such as the world has rarely seen
before or since; a chaos which reached its culmination in the
seventh century, the age of Justinian and Theodora, perhaps the
two most hideous sovereigns, worshipped by the most hideous
empire of parasites and hypocrites, cowards and wantons, that
ever insulted the long-suffering of a righteous God.</p>
<p>But, for Alexandria at least, the cup was now full.&nbsp; In
the year 640 the Alexandrians were tearing each other in pieces
about some Jacobite and Melchite controversy, to me
incomprehensible, to you unimportant, because the fighters on
both sides seem to have lost (as all parties do in their old age)
the knowledge of what they were fighting for, and to have so
bewildered the question with personal intrigues, spites, and
quarrels, as to make it nearly as enigmatic as that famous
contemporary war between the blue and green factions at
Constantinople, which began by backing in the theatre, the
charioteers who drove in blue dresses, against those wild drove
in green; then went on to identify themselves each with one of
the prevailing theological factions; gradually developed, the one
into an aristocratic, the other into a democratic, religious
party; and ended by a civil war in the streets of Constantinople,
accompanied by the most horrible excesses, which had nearly, at
one time, given up the city to the flames, and driven Justinian
from his throne.</p>
<p>In the midst of these Jacobite and Melchite controversies and
riots, appeared before the city the armies of certain wild and
unlettered Arab tribes.&nbsp; A short and fruitless struggle
followed; and, strange to say, a few months swept away from the
face of the earth, not only the wealth, the commerce, the
castles, and the liberty, but the philosophy and the Christianity
of Alexandria; crushed to powder by one fearful blow, all that
had been built up by Alexander and the Ptolemies, by Clement and
the philosophers, and made void, to all appearance, nine hundred
years of human toil.&nbsp; The people, having no real hold on
their hereditary Creed, accepted, by tens of thousands, that of
the Mussulman invaders.&nbsp; The Christian remnant became
tributaries; and Alexandria dwindled, from that time forth, into
a petty seaport town.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;can we pass over this new metaphysical school of
Alexandria? Can we help inquiring in what the strength of
Islamism lay?&nbsp; I, at least, cannot.&nbsp; I cannot help
feeling that I am bound to examine in what relation the creed of
Omar and Amrou stands to the Alexandrian speculations of five
hundred years, and how it had power to sweep those speculations
utterly from the Eastern mind.&nbsp; It is a difficult problem;
to me, as a Christian priest, a very awful problem.&nbsp; What
more awful historic problem, than to see the lower creed
destroying the higher? to see God, as it were, undoing his own
work, and repenting Him that He had made man?&nbsp; Awful indeed:
but I can honestly say, that it is one from the investigation of
which I have learnt&mdash;I cannot yet tell how much: and of this
I am sure, that without that old Alexandrian philosophy, I should
not have been able to do justice to Islam; without Islam I should
not have been able to find in that Alexandrian philosophy, an
ever-living and practical element.</p>
<p>I must, however, first entreat you to dismiss from your minds
the vulgar notion that Mohammed was in anywise a bad man, or a
conscious deceiver, pretending to work miracles, or to do things
which he did not do.&nbsp; He sinned in one instance: but, as far
as I can see, only in that one&mdash;I mean against what he must
have known to be right.&nbsp; I allude to his relaxing in his own
case those wise restrictions on polygamy which he had
proclaimed.&nbsp; And yet, even in this case, the desire for a
child may have been the true cause of his weakness.&nbsp; He did
not see the whole truth, of course: but he was an infinitely
better man than the men around: perhaps, all in all, one of the
best men of his day.&nbsp; Many here may have read Mr.
Carlyle&rsquo;s vindication of Mohammed in his Lectures on Hero
Worship; to those who have not, I shall only say, that I entreat
them to do so; and that I assure them, that though I differ in
many things utterly from Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s inferences and
deductions in that lecture, yet that I am convinced, from my own
acquaintance with the original facts and documents, that the
picture there drawn of Mohammed is a true and a just description
of a much-calumniated man.</p>
<p>Now, what was the strength of Islam?&nbsp; The common answer
is, fanaticism and enthusiasm.&nbsp; To such answers I can only
rejoin: Such terms must be defined before they are used, and we
must be told what fanaticism and enthusiasm are.&nbsp; Till then
I have no more <i>&agrave; priori</i> respect for a long word
ending in -ism or -asm than I have for one ending in -ation or
-ality.&nbsp; But while fanaticism and enthusiasm are being
defined&mdash;a work more difficult than is commonly
fancied&mdash;we will go on to consider another answer.&nbsp; We
are told that the strength of Islam lay in the hope of their
sensuous Paradise and fear of their sensuous Gehenna.&nbsp; If
so, this is the first and last time in the world&rsquo;s history
that the strength of any large body of people&mdash;perhaps of
any single man&mdash;lay in such a hope.&nbsp; History gives us
innumerable proofs that such merely selfish motives are the
parents of slavish impotence, of pedantry and conceit, of pious
frauds, often of the most devilish cruelty: but, as far as my
reading extends, of nothing better.&nbsp; Moreover, the Christian
Greeks had much the same hopes on those points as the Mussulmans;
and similar causes should produce similar effects: but those
hopes gave them no strength.&nbsp; Besides, according to the
Mussulmans&rsquo; own account, this was <i>not</i> their great
inspiring idea; and it is absurd to consider the wild
battle-cries of a few imaginative youths, about black-eyed and
green-kerchiefed Houris calling to them from the skies, as
representing the average feelings of a generation of sober and
self-restraining men, who showed themselves actuated by far
higher motives.</p>
<p>Another answer, and one very popular now, is that the
Mussulmans were strong, because they believed what they said; and
the Greeks weak, because they did not believe what they
said.&nbsp; From this notion I shall appeal to another doctrine
of the very same men who put it forth, and ask them, Can any man
be strong by believing a lie?&nbsp; Have you not told us, nobly
enough, that every lie is by its nature rotten, doomed to death,
certain to prove its own impotence, and be shattered to atoms the
moment you try to use it, to bring it into rude actual contact
with fact, and Nature, and the eternal laws?&nbsp; Faith to be
strong must be faith in something which is not one&rsquo;s self;
faith in something eternal, something objective, something true,
which would exist just as much though we and all the world
disbelieved it.&nbsp; The strength of belief comes from that
which is believed in; if you separate it from that, it becomes a
mere self-opinion, a sensation of positiveness; and what sort of
strength that will give, history will tell us in the tragedies of
the Jews who opposed Titus, of the rabble who followed Walter the
Penniless to the Crusades, of the Munster Anabaptists, and many
another sad page of human folly.&nbsp; It may give the fury of
idiots; not the deliberate might of valiant men.&nbsp; Let us
pass this by, then; believing that faith can only give strength
where it is faith in something true and right: and go on to
another answer almost as popular as the last.</p>
<p>We are told that the might of Islam lay in a certain innate
force and savage virtue of the Arab character.&nbsp; If we have
discovered this in the followers of Mohammed, they certainly had
not discovered it in themselves.&nbsp; They spoke of themselves,
rightly or wrongly, as men who had received a divine light, and
that light a moral light, to teach them to love that which was
good, and refuse that which was evil; and to that divine light
they stedfastly and honestly attributed every right action of
their lives.&nbsp; Most noble and affecting, in my eyes, is that
answer of Saad&rsquo;s aged envoy to Yezdegird, king of Persia,
when he reproached him with the past savagery and poverty of the
Arabs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatsoever thou hast said,&rdquo; answered
the old man, &ldquo;regarding the former condition of the Arabs
is true.&nbsp; Their food <i>was</i> green lizards; they buried
their infant daughters alive; nay, some of them feasted on dead
carcases, and drank blood; while others slew their kinsfolk, and
thought themselves great and valiant, when by so doing they
became possessed of more property.&nbsp; They <i>were</i> clothed
with hair garments, they knew not good from evil, and made no
distinction between that which was lawful and unlawful.&nbsp;
Such was our state; but God in his mercy has sent us, by a holy
prophet, a sacred volume, which teaches us the true
faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words, I think, show us the secret of Islam.&nbsp; They
are a just comment on that short and rugged chapter of the Koran
which is said to have been Mohammed&rsquo;s first attempt either
at prophecy or writing; when, after long fasting and meditation
among the desert hills, under the glorious eastern stars, he came
down and told his good Kadijah that he had found a great thing,
and that she must help him to write it down.&nbsp; And what was
this which seemed to the unlettered camel-driver so priceless a
treasure?&nbsp; Not merely that God was one God&mdash;vast as
that discovery was&mdash;but that he was a God &ldquo;who showeth
to man the thing which he knew not;&rdquo; a &ldquo;most merciful
God;&rdquo; a God, in a word, who could be trusted; a God who
would teach and strengthen; a God, as he said, who would give him
courage to set his face like a flint, and would put an answer in
his mouth when his idolatrous countrymen cavilled and sneered at
his message to them, to turn from their idols of wood and stone,
and become righteous men, as Abraham their forefather was
righteous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A God who showeth to man the thing which he knew
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; That idea gave might to Islam, because it was a
real idea, an eternal fact; the result of a true insight into the
character of God.&nbsp; And that idea alone, believe me, will
give conquering might either to creed, philosophy, or heart of
man.&nbsp; Each will be strong, each will endure, in proportion
as it believes that God is one who shows to man the thing which
he knew not: as it believes, in short, in that Logos of which
Saint John wrote, that He was the light who lightens every man
who comes into the world.</p>
<p>In a word, the wild Koreish had discovered, more or less
clearly, that end and object of all metaphysic whereof I have
already spoken so often; that external and imperishable beauty
for which Plato sought of old; and had seen that its name was
righteousness, and that it dwelt absolutely in an absolutely
righteous person; and moreover, that this person was no careless
self-contented epicurean deity; but that He was, as they loved to
call Him, the most merciful God; that He cared for men; that He
desired to make men righteous.&nbsp; Of that they could not
doubt.&nbsp; The fact was palpable, historic, present.&nbsp; To
them the degraded Koreish of the desert, who as they believed,
and I think believed rightly, had fallen from the old Monotheism
of their forefathers Abraham and Ismael, into the lowest
fetishism, and with that into the lowest brutality and
wretchedness&mdash;to them, while they were making idols of wood
and stone; eating dead carcases; and burying their daughters
alive; careless of chastity, of justice, of property; sunk in
unnatural crimes, dead in trespasses and sins; hateful and hating
one another&mdash;a man, one of their own people had come,
saying: &ldquo;I have a message from the one righteous God.&nbsp;
His curse is on all this, for it is unlike Himself.&nbsp; He will
have you righteous men, after the pattern of your forefather
Abraham.&nbsp; Be that, and arise, body, soul, and spirit, out of
your savagery and brutishness.&nbsp; Then you shall be able to
trample under font the profligate idolaters, to sweep the Greek
tyrants from the land which they have been oppressing for
centuries, and to recover the East for its rightful heirs, the
children of Abraham.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was this not, in every sense, a
message from God?&nbsp; I must deny the philosophy of Clement and
Augustine, I must deny my own conscience, my own reason, I must
outrage my own moral sense, and confess that I have no immutable
standard of right, that I know no eternal source of right, if I
deny it to have been one; if I deny what seems to me the palpable
historic fact, that those wild Koreish had in them a reason and a
conscience, which could awaken to that message, and perceive its
boundless beauty, its boundless importance, and that they did
accept that message, and lived by it in proportion as they
received it fully, such lives as no men in those times, and few
in after times, have been able to live.&nbsp; If I feel, as I do
feel, that Abubekr, Omar, Abu Obeidah, and Amrou, were better men
than I am, I must throw away all that Philo&mdash;all that a
Higher authority&mdash;has taught me: or I must attribute their
lofty virtues to the one source of all in man which is not
selfishness, and fancy, and fury, and blindness as of the beasts
which perish.</p>
<p>Why, then, has Islamism become one of the most patent and
complete failures upon earth, if the true test of a
system&rsquo;s success be the gradual progress and amelioration
of the human beings who are under its influence?&nbsp; First, I
believe, from its allowing polygamy.&nbsp; I do not judge
Mohammed for having allowed it.&nbsp; He found it one of the
ancestral and immemorial customs of his nation.&nbsp; He found it
throughout the Hebrew Scriptures.&nbsp; He found it in the case
of Abraham, his ideal man; and, as he believed, the
divinely-inspired ancestor of his race.&nbsp; It seemed to him
that what was right for Abraham, could not be wrong for an
Arab.&nbsp; God shall judge him, not I.&nbsp; Moreover, the
Christians of the East, divided into either monks or profligates;
and with far lower and more brutal notions of the married state
than were to be found in Arab poetry and legend, were the very
last men on earth to make him feel the eternal and divine beauty
of that pure wedded love which Christianity has not only
proclaimed, but commanded, and thereby emancipated woman from her
old slavery to the stronger sex.&nbsp; And I believe, from his
chivalrous faithfulness to his good wife Kadijah, as long as she
lived, that Mohammed was a man who could have accepted that great
truth in all its fulness, had he but been taught it.&nbsp; He
certainly felt the evil of polyamy so strongly as to restrict it
in every possible way, except the only right way&mdash;namely,
the proclamation of the true ideal of marriage.&nbsp; But his
ignorance, mistake, sin, if you will, was a deflection from the
right law, from the true constitution of man, and therefore it
avenged itself.&nbsp; That chivalrous respect for woman, which
was so strong in the early Mohammedans, died out.&nbsp; The women
themselves&mdash;who, in the first few years of Islamism, rose as
the men rose, and became their helpmates, counsellors, and
fellow-warriors&mdash;degenerated rapidly into mere
playthings.&nbsp; I need not enter into the painful subject of
woman&rsquo;s present position in the East, and the social
consequences thereof.&nbsp; But I firmly believe, not merely as a
theory, but as a fact which may be proved by abundant evidence,
that to polygamy alone is owing nine-tenths of the present decay
and old age of every Mussulman nation; and that till it be
utterly abolished, all Western civilisation and capital, and all
the civil and religious liberty on earth, will not avail one jot
toward their revival.&nbsp; You must regenerate the family before
you can regenerate the nation, and the relation of husband and
wife before the family; because, as long as the root is corrupt,
the fruit will be corrupt also.</p>
<p>But there is another cause of the failure of Islamism, more
intimately connected with those metaphysical questions which we
have been hitherto principally considering.</p>
<p>Among the first Mussulmans, as I have said, there was
generally the most intense belief in each man that he was
personally under a divine guide and teacher.&nbsp; But their
creed contained nothing which could keep up that belief in the
minds of succeeding generations.&nbsp; They had destroyed the
good with the evil, and they paid the penalty of their
undistinguishing wrath.&nbsp; In sweeping away the idolatries and
fetish worships of the Syrian Catholics, the Mussulmans had swept
away also that doctrine which alone can deliver men from idolatry
and fetish worships&mdash;if not outward and material ones, yet
the still more subtle, and therefore more dangerous idolatries of
the intellect.&nbsp; For they had swept away the belief in the
Logos; in a divine teacher of every human soul, who was, in some
mysterious way, the pattern and antitype of human virtue and
wisdom.&nbsp; And more, they had swept away that belief in the
incarnation of the Logos, which alone can make man feel that his
divine teacher is one who can enter into the human duties,
sorrows, doubts, of each human spirit.&nbsp; And, therefore, when
Mohammed and his personal friends were dead, the belief in a
present divine teacher, on the whole, died with them; and the
Mussulmans began to put the Koran in the place of Him of whom the
Koran spoke.&nbsp; They began to worship the book&mdash;which
after all is not a book, but only an irregular collection of
Mohammed&rsquo;s meditations, and notes for sermons&mdash;with
the most slavish and ridiculous idolatry.&nbsp; They fell into a
cabbalism, and a superstitious reverence for the mere letters and
words of the Koran, to which the cabbalism of the old Rabbis was
moderate and rational.&nbsp; They surrounded it, and the history
of Mohammed, with all ridiculous myths, and prodigies, and lying
wonders, whereof the book itself contained not a word; and which
Mohammed, during his existence, had denied and repudiated, saying
that he worked no miracles, and that none were needed; because
only reason was required to show a man the hand of a good God in
all human affairs.&nbsp; Nevertheless, these later Mussulmans
found the miracles necessary to confirm their faith: and
why?&nbsp; Because they had lost the sense of a present God, a
God of order; and therefore hankered, as men in such a mood
always will, after prodigious and unnatural proofs of His having
been once present with their founder Mohammed.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile that absolute and omnipotent Being whom
Mohammed, arising out of his great darkness, had so nobly
preached to the Koreish, receded in the minds of their
descendants to an unapproachable and abysmal distance.&nbsp; For
they had lost the sense of His present guidance, His personal
care.&nbsp; They had lost all which could connect Him with the
working of their own souls, with their human duties and
struggles, with the belief that His mercy and love were
counterparts of human mercy and human love; in plain English,
that He was loving and merciful at all.&nbsp; The change came
very gradually, thank God; you may read of noble sayings and
deeds here and there, for many centuries after Mohammed: but it
came; and then their belief in God&rsquo;s omnipotence and
absoluteness dwindled into the most dark, and slavish, and
benumbing fatalism.&nbsp; His unchangeableness became in their
minds not an unchangeable purpose to teach, forgive, and deliver
men&mdash;as it seemed to Mohammed to have been&mdash;but a mere
brute necessity, an unchangeable purpose to have His own way,
whatsoever that way might be.&nbsp; That dark fatalism, also, has
helped toward the decay of the Mohammedan nations.&nbsp; It has
made them careless of self-improvement; faithless of the
possibility of progress; and has kept, and will keep, the
Mohammedan nations, in all intellectual matters, whole ages
behind the Christian nations of the West.</p>
<p>How far the story of Omar&rsquo;s commanding the baths of
Alexandria to be heated with the books from the great library is
true, we shall never know.&nbsp; Some have doubted the story
altogether: but so many fresh corroborations of it are said to
have been lately discovered, in Arabic writers, that I can hardly
doubt that it had some foundation in fact.&nbsp; One cannot but
believe that John Philoponus, the last of the Alexandrian
grammarians, when he asked his patron Amrou the gift of the
library, took care to save some, at least, of its treasures; and
howsoever strongly Omar may have felt or said that all books
which agreed with the Koran were useless, and all which disagreed
with it only fit to be destroyed, the general feeling of the
Mohammedan leaders was very different.&nbsp; As they settled in
the various countries which they conquered, education seems to
have been considered by them an important object.&nbsp; We even
find some of them, in the same generation as Mohammed, obeying
strictly the Prophet&rsquo;s command to send all captive children
to school&mdash;a fact which speaks as well for the
Mussulmans&rsquo; good sense, as it speaks ill for the state of
education among the degraded descendants of the Greek conquerors
of the East.&nbsp; Gradually philosophic Schools arose, first at
Bagdad, and then at Cordova; and the Arabs carried on the task of
commenting on Aristotle&rsquo;s Logic, and Ptolemy&rsquo;s
Megiste Syntaxis&mdash;which last acquired from them the name of
Almagest, by which it was so long known during the Middle
Ages.</p>
<p>But they did little but comment, though there was no
Neoplatonic or mystic element in their commentaries.&nbsp; It
seems as if Alexandria was preordained, by its very central
position, to be the city of commentators, not of
originators.&nbsp; It is worthy of remark, that Philoponus, who
may be considered as the man who first introduced the simple
warriors of the Koreish to the treasures of Greek thought, seems
to have been the first rebel against the Neoplatonist
eclecticism.&nbsp; He maintained, and truly, that Porphyry,
Proclus, and the rest, had entirely misunderstood Aristotle, when
they attempted to reconcile him with Plato, or incorporate his
philosophy into Platonism.&nbsp; Aristotle was henceforth the
text-book of Arab savants.&nbsp; It was natural enough.&nbsp; The
Mussulman mind was trained in habits of absolute obedience to the
authority of fixed dogmas.&nbsp; All those attempts to follow out
metaphysic to its highest object, theology, would be useless if
not wrong in the eyes of a Mussulman, who had already his simple
and sharply-defined creed on all matters relating to the unseen
world.&nbsp; With him metaphysic was a study altogether divorced
from man&rsquo;s higher life and aspirations.&nbsp; So also were
physics.&nbsp; What need had he of Cosmogonies? what need to
trace the relations between man and the universe, or the universe
and its Maker?&nbsp; He had his definite material Elysium and
Tartarus, as the only ultimate relation between man and the
universe; his dogma of an absolute fiat, creating arbitrary and
once for all, as the only relation between the universe and its
Maker: and further it was not lawful to speculate.&nbsp; The idea
which I believe unites both physic and metaphysic with
man&rsquo;s highest inspirations and widest
speculations&mdash;the Alexandria idea of the Logos, of the Deity
working in time and space by successive thoughts&mdash;he had not
heard of; for it was dead, as I have said, in Alexandria itself;
and if he had heard of it, he would have spurned it as detracting
from the absoluteness of that abysmal one Being, of whom he so
nobly yet so partially bore witness.&nbsp; So it was to be;
doubtless it was right that it should be so.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s
eye is too narrow to see a whole truth, his brain too weak to
carry a whole truth.&nbsp; Better for him, and better for the
world, is perhaps the method on which man has been educated in
every age, by which to each school, or party, or nation, is given
some one great truth, which they are to work out to its highest
development, to exemplify in actual life, leaving some happier
age&mdash;perhaps, alas! only some future state&mdash;to
reconcile that too favoured dogma with other truths which lie
beside it, and without which it is always incomplete, and
sometimes altogether barren.</p>
<p>But such schools of science, founded on such a ground as this,
on the mere instinct of curiosity, had little chance of
originality or vitality.&nbsp; All the great schools of the
world, the elder Greek philosophy, the Alexandrian, the present
Baconian school of physics, have had a deeper motive for their
search, a far higher object which they hope to discover.&nbsp;
But indeed, the Mussulmans did not so much wish to discover
truth, as to cultivate their own intellects.&nbsp; For that
purpose a sharp and subtle systematist, like Aristotle, was the
very man whom they required; and from the destruction of
Alexandria may date the rise of the Aristotelian
philosophy.&nbsp; Translations of his works were made into
Arabic, first, it is said, from Persian and Syriac translations;
the former of which had been made during the sixth and seventh
centuries, by the wreck of the Neoplatonist party, during their
visit to the philosophic Chozroos.&nbsp; A century after, they
filled Alexandria.&nbsp; After them Almansoor, Hairoun Alraschid,
and their successors, who patronised the Nestorian Christians,
obtained from them translations of the philosophic, medical, and
astronomical Greek works; while the last of the Omniades,
Abdalrahman, had introduced the same literary taste into Spain,
where, in the thirteenth century, Averro&euml;s and Maimonides
rivalled the fame of Avicenna, who had flourished at Bagdad a
century before.</p>
<p>But, as I have said already, these Arabs seem to have invented
nothing; they only commented.&nbsp; And yet not only commented;
for they preserved for us those works of whose real value they
were so little aware.&nbsp; Averro&euml;s, in quality of
commentator on Aristotle, became his rival in the minds of the
medi&aelig;val schoolmen; Avicenna, in quality of commentator on
Hippocrates and Galen, was for centuries the text-book of all
European physicians; while Albatani and Aboul Wefa, as
astronomers, commented on Ptolemy, not however without making a
few important additions to his knowledge; for Aboul Wefa
discovered a third inequality of the moon&rsquo;s motion, in
addition to the two mentioned by Ptolemy, which he did, according
to Professor Whewell, in a truly philosophic manner&mdash;an
apparently solitary instance, and one which, in its own day, had
no effect; for the fact was forgotten, and rediscovered centuries
after by Tycho Brahe.&nbsp; To Albatani, however, we owe two
really valuable heirlooms.&nbsp; The one is the use of the sine,
or half-chord of the double arc, instead of the chord of the arc
itself, which had been employed by the Greek astronomers; the
other, of even more practical benefit, was the introduction of
the present decimal arithmetic, instead of the troublesome
sexagesimal arithmetic of the Greeks.&nbsp; These ten digits,
however, seem, says Professor Whewell, by the confession of the
Arabians themselves, to be of Indian origin, and thus form no
exception to the sterility of the Arabian genius in scientific
inventions.&nbsp; Nevertheless we are bound, in all fairness, to
set against his condemnation of the Arabs Professor De
Morgan&rsquo;s opinion of the Moslem, in his article on Euclid:
&ldquo;Some writers speak slightingly of this progress, the
results of which they are too apt to compare with those of our
own time.&nbsp; They ought rather to place the Saracens by the
side of their own Gothic ancestors; and making some allowance for
the more advantageous circumstances under which the first
started, they should view the second systematically dispersing
the remains of Greek civilisation, while the first were
concentrating the geometry of Alexandria, the arithmetic and
algebra of India, and the astronomy of both, to form a nucleus
for the present state of science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this article of Professor De Morgan&rsquo;s on Euclid, <a
name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127"
class="citation">[127]</a> and to Professor Whewell&rsquo;s
excellent &ldquo;History of the Inductive Sciences,&rdquo; from
which I, being neither Arabic scholar nor astronomer, have drawn
most of my facts about physical science, I must refer those who
wish to know more of the early rise of physics, and of their
preservation by the Arabs, till a great and unexpected event
brought them back again to the quarter of the globe where they
had their birth, and where alone they could be regenerated into a
new and practical life.</p>
<p>That great event was the Crusades.&nbsp; We have heard little
of Alexandria lately.&nbsp; Its intellectual glory had departed
westward and eastward, to Cordova and to Bagdad; its commercial
greatness had left it for Cairo and Damietta.&nbsp; But Egypt was
still the centre of communication between the two great stations
of the Moslem power, and indeed, as Mr. Lane has shown in his
most valuable translation of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo;
possessed a peculiar life and character of its own.</p>
<p>It was the rash object of the Crusaders to extinguish that
life.&nbsp; Palestine was their first point of attack: but the
later Crusaders seem to have found, like the rest of the world,
that the destinies of Palestine could not be separated from those
of Egypt; and to Damietta, accordingly, was directed that last
disastrous attempt of St. Louis, which all may read so
graphically described in the pages of Joinville.</p>
<p>The Crusaders failed utterly of the object at which they
aimed.&nbsp; They succeeded in an object of which they never
dreamed; for in those Crusades the Moslem and the Christian had
met face to face, and found that both were men, that they had a
common humanity, a common eternal standard of nobleness and
virtue.&nbsp; So the Christian knights went home humbler and
wiser men, when they found in the Saracen emirs the same
generosity, truth, mercy, chivalrous self-sacrifice, which they
had fancied their own peculiar possession, and added to that, a
civilisation and a learning which they could only admire and
imitate.&nbsp; And thus, from the era of the Crusades, a kindlier
feeling sprang up between the Crescent and the Cross, till it was
again broken by the fearful invasions of the Turks throughout
Eastern Europe.&nbsp; The learning of the Moslem, as well as
their commerce, began to pour rapidly into Christendom, both from
Spain, Egypt, and Syria; and thus the Crusaders were, indeed,
rewarded according to their deeds.&nbsp; They had fancied that
they were bound to vindicate the possession of the earth for Him
to whom they believed the earth belonged.&nbsp; He showed
them&mdash;or rather He has shown us, their children&mdash;that
He can vindicate His own dominion better far than man can do it
for Him; and their cruel and unjust aim was utterly foiled.&nbsp;
That was not the way to make men know or obey Him.&nbsp; They
took the sword, and perished by the sword.&nbsp; But the truly
noble element in them&mdash;the element which our hearts and
reasons recognise and love, in spite of all the loud words about
the folly and fanaticism of the Crusades, whensoever we read
&ldquo;The Talisman&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ivanhoe&rdquo;&mdash;the
element of loyal faith and self-sacrifice&mdash;did not go
unrequited.&nbsp; They learnt wider, juster views of man and
virtue, which I cannot help believing must have had great effect
in weakening in their minds their old, exclusive, and bigoted
notions, and in paving the way for the great outburst of free
thought, and the great assertion of the dignity of humanity,
which the fifteenth century beheld.&nbsp; They opened a path for
that influx of scientific knowledge which has produced, in after
centuries, the most enormous effects on the welfare of Europe,
and made life possible for millions who would otherwise have been
pent within the narrow bounds of Europe, to devour each other in
the struggle for room and bread.</p>
<p>But those Arabic translations of Greek authors were a fatal
gift for Egypt, and scarcely less fatal gift for Bagdad.&nbsp; In
that Almagest of Ptolemy, in that Organon of Aristotle, which the
Crusaders are said to have brought home, lay, rude and embryotic,
the germs of that physical science, that geographical knowledge
which has opened to the European the commerce and the
colonisation of the globe.&nbsp; Within three hundred years after
his works reached Europe, Ptolemy had taught the Portuguese to
sail round Africa; and from that day the stream of eastern wealth
flowed no longer through the Red Sea, or the Persian Gulf, on its
way to the new countries of the West; and not only Alexandria,
but Damietta and Bagdad, dwindled down to their present
insignificance.&nbsp; And yet the whirligig of time brings about
its revenges.&nbsp; The stream of commerce is now rapidly turning
back to its old channel; and British science bids fair to make
Alexandria once more the inn of all the nations.</p>
<p>It is with a feeling of awe that one looks upon the huge
possibilities of her future.&nbsp; Her own physical capacities,
as the great mind of Napoleon saw, are what they always have
been, inexhaustible; and science has learnt to set at naught the
only defect of situation which has ever injured her prosperity,
namely, the short land passage from the Nile to the Red
Sea.&nbsp; The fate of Palestine is now more than ever bound up
with her fate; and a British or French colony might, holding the
two countries, develop itself into a nation as vast as sprang
from Alexander&rsquo;s handful of Macedonians, and become the
meeting point for the nations of the West and those great
Anglo-Saxon peoples who seem destined to spring up in the
Australian ocean.&nbsp; Wide as the dream may appear, steam has
made it a far narrower one than the old actual fact, that for
centuries the Phoenician and the Arabian interchanged at
Alexandria the produce of Britain for that of Ceylon and
Hindostan.&nbsp; And as for intellectual development, though
Alexandria wants, as she has always wanted, that insular and
exclusive position which seems almost necessary to develop
original thought and original national life, yet she may still
act as the point of fusion for distinct schools and polities, and
the young and buoyant vigour of the new-born nations may at once
teach, and learn from, the prudence, the experience, the
traditional wisdom of the ancient Europeans.</p>
<p>This vision, however possible, may be a far-off one: but the
first step towards it, at least, is being laid before our
eyes&mdash;and that is, a fresh reconciliation between the
Crescent and the Cross.&nbsp; Apart from all political
considerations, which would be out of place here, I hail, as a
student of philosophy, the school which is now, both in
Alexandria and in Constantinople, teaching to Moslem and to
Christians the same lesson which the Crusaders learnt in Egypt
five hundred years ago.&nbsp; A few years&rsquo; more
perseverance in the valiant and righteous course which Britain
has now chosen, will reward itself by opening a vast field for
capital and enterprise, for the introduction of civil and
religious liberty among the down-trodden peasantry of Egypt; as
the Giaour becomes an object of respect, and trust, and gratitude
to the Moslem; and as the feeling that Moslem and Giaour own a
common humanity, a common eternal standard of justice and mercy,
a common sacred obligation to perform our promises, and to
succour the oppressed, shall have taken place of the old brute
wonder at our careless audacity, and awkward assertion of power,
which now expresses itself in the somewhat left-handed
Alexandrian compliment&mdash;&ldquo;There is one Satan, and there
are many Satans: but there is no Satan like a Frank in a round
hat.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It would be both uncourteous and unfair of me to close these
my hasty Lectures, without expressing my hearty thanks for the
great courtesy and kindness which I have received in this my
first visit to your most noble and beautiful city; and often, I
am proud to say, from those who differ from me deeply on many
important points; and also for the attention with which I have
been listened to while trying, clumsily enough, to explain dry
and repulsive subjects, and to express opinions which may be new,
and perhaps startling, to many of my hearers.&nbsp; If my
imperfect hints shall have stirred up but one hearer to
investigate this obscure and yet most important subject, and to
examine for himself the original documents, I shall feel that my
words in this place have not been spoken in vain; for even if
such a seeker should arrive at conclusions different from my own
(and I pretend to no infallibility), he will at least have learnt
new facts, the parents of new thought, perhaps of new action; he
will have come face to face with new human beings, in whom he
will have been compelled to take a human interest; and will
surely rise from his researches, let them lead him where they
will, at least somewhat of a wider-minded and a wider-hearted
man.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
